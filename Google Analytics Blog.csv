2018-07-12T12:30:00.000-04:00;Google Measurement Partners: Trusted measurement solutions for the entire customer journey;<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left ">We believe that measurement you can trust is critical for brands trying to understand the impact of their marketing. But as the customer journey has become more complex, measurement has become increasingly challenging. And while Google strives to build great solutions, some marketers prefer to rely on third-party measurement solutions.<br /><br />That’s why we’re announcing Google Measurement Partners, a program that brings together new and existing partnerships to offer brands a variety of options to measure their advertising media.<br /><br />The program is launching with 20+ verified partners across seven specializations: viewability, reach, brand safety, brand lift, sales lift, app attribution, and marketing mix modeling. Partners offer various solutions that work across Google advertising products, including <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2018-q3-gbl-all-google-marketing-platform&amp utm_content=announcement-gml-2018-google-measurement-partners" target="_blank">Google Marketing Platform</a> (including Display &amp Video 360 and Search Ads 360), Google Ads, YouTube, and more. Existing partner programs like App Attribution and Marketing Mix Modeling are now included in Google Measurement Partners.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1N6_f-0CIM4/W0dhQg1VCmI/AAAAAAAADbw/Ce4TAydHM3YAIiwjuJtZ7AaGUI_n4UMigCLcBGAs/s1600/Measurement%2BPartners.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1N6_f-0CIM4/W0dhQg1VCmI/AAAAAAAADbw/Ce4TAydHM3YAIiwjuJtZ7AaGUI_n4UMigCLcBGAs/s640/Measurement%2BPartners.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />Our launch partners are recognized leaders within their focus areas and provide solutions widely used by the industry. They meet rigorous standards for accuracy and use reliable methodologies to measure KPIs that matter for marketers.

2018-07-11T14:00:00.000-04:00;Better understand and reach your customers with new Cross Device capabilities in Google Analytics;<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VXWAC8V4zPw/W04qtKxkTcI/AAAAAAAADb8/cmj0D_b_C6AFqUMd5pS_j3zj-RdhtAyRQCLcBGAs/s1600/Cross%2BDevice%2BAnalytics.gif" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" height="266" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VXWAC8V4zPw/W04qtKxkTcI/AAAAAAAADb8/cmj0D_b_C6AFqUMd5pS_j3zj-RdhtAyRQCLcBGAs/s640/Cross%2BDevice%2BAnalytics.gif" width="640" /></a></div><br />Today, we’re introducing new Cross Device features to Google Analytics. Analytics will now help you understand the journey your customers are taking across their devices as they interact with your website, giving you a complete view of the impact of your marketing so you can run smarter campaigns that deliver more tailored experiences to your customers.<br /><br /><strong>Piecing together a more complete picture</strong><br /><br />Cross Device reporting in Analytics takes into account people who visit your website multiple times from different devices. Now, instead of seeing metrics in Analytics that show two separate sessions (e.g., one on desktop and the other on mobile), you’ll be able to see when users visited your website from two different devices. By understanding these device interactions as part of a broader customer experience, you can make more informed product and marketing decisions.<br /><br />Say you’re a marketer for a travel company. With the new Acquisition Device report, you may find that a lot of your customers first come to your website on mobile to do their initial research before booking a trip later on desktop. Based on that insight, you might choose to prioritize mobile ad campaigns to reach people as they start to plan their trip.<br /><br />In addition to the Acquisition Device report, you’ll soon have access to other Cross Device reports like Device Overlap, Device Paths and Channels. Our Cross Device reports only display aggregated and anonymized data from people who have opted in to personalized advertising (as always users can <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">opt out</a> at any time).<br /><br /><strong>Reaching the right customers along the way</strong><br /><br />Analytics will also now help you create smarter audiences based on the actions people take on various devices. That way you can deliver more relevant and useful experiences.<br /><br />Let’s say you’re a shoe retailer and you want to share a special promotion with your most loyal customers. You decide this means people who have purchased more than $500 in shoes on your website in the last 12 months using any of their devices. If a group of customers buy $300 worth of shoes on their phone and another $300 on their desktop, they’re just as valuable as another group who spend $600 on a single device, right?<br /><br />Analytics now understands that these two groups of customers actually spent the same amount on your website, helping you create a more accurate audience list to reach the right customers. And spend isn’t the only way to segment and build audiences. You can also create remarketing campaigns to reach audiences based on how many times they visit your website across multiple devices.<br /><br /><strong>Get started</strong><br /><br />To use these new Cross Device features, start by visiting the Admin section of your Analytics account and choose the setting to <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7532985#enabling" target="_blank">activate Google signals</a>. (If you don’t see this setting, you will soon—we’ll roll it out to all Analytics accounts over the coming weeks.) There’s no need to update your website code or get additional assistance from a developer.<br /><br />With these new beta features in Analytics, we hope you’ll quickly see that by better understanding the customer journey across devices, you can create more relevant and useful experiences for your customers.<br /><br /><span class="byline-author">Posted by Jesse Savage, Director, Product Management, Google Analytics</span></div><div class="feedflare">. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=OWHVt1DeNzg:y6yDfIjGw_c:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=OWHVt1DeNzg:y6yDfIjGw_c:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?i=OWHVt1DeNzg:y6yDfIjGw_c:-BTjWOF_DHI" /></a>. </div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~4/OWHVt1DeNzg" width="1" />;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~3/OWHVt1DeNzg/cross-device-capabilities-mktg.html

We’ll explore how this technology works in our products and <a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2018/01/adwords-machine-learning-part-1.html" target="_blank">why it’s key</a> to delivering the helpful and frictionless experiences consumers expect from brands.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmfaZV96x7A" target="_blank">Join us live</a> today at 9am PT (12pm ET).<br /><br /><strong>Deliver more relevance with responsive search ads</strong><br /><br />Consumers today are more curious, more demanding, and they expect to get things done faster because of mobile. As a result, they expect your ads to be helpful and personalized. Doing this isn’t easy, especially at scale. That’s why we’re introducing <strong>responsive search ads</strong>. <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7684791" target="_blank">Responsive search ads</a> combine your creativity with the power of Google’s machine learning to help you deliver relevant, valuable ads.<br /><br />Simply provide up to 15 headlines and 4 description lines, and Google will do the rest. By testing different combinations, Google learns which ad creative performs best for any search query. So people searching for the same thing might see different ads based on context.<br /><br />We know this kind of optimization works: on average, advertisers who use Google’s machine learning to test multiple creative see up to 15 percent more clicks.<sup>1</sup> Responsive search ads will start rolling out to advertisers over the next several months.<br /><br /><strong>Maximize relevance and performance on YouTube</strong><br /><br />People watch over 1 billion hours of video on YouTube every day. And increasingly, they’re tuning in for inspiration and information on purchases large and small. For example, nearly 1 in 2 car buyers say they turn to YouTube for information before their purchase.<sup>2</sup> And nearly 1 in 2 millennials go there for food preparation tips before deciding what ingredients to buy.<sup>3</sup> That means it’s critical your video ads show at the right moment to the right audience.<br /><br />Machine learning helps us turn that attention into results on YouTube. In the past, we’ve helped you optimize campaigns for views and impressions. Later this year, we’re rolling out <strong>Maximize lift</strong> to help you reach people who are most likely to consider your brand after seeing a video ad. This new <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7065882" target="_blank">Smart Bidding</a> strategy is also powered by machine learning. It automatically adjusts bids at auction time to maximize the impact your video ads have on brand perception throughout the consumer journey.<br /><br />Maximize lift is available now as a beta and will roll out to advertisers globally later this year.<br /><br /><strong>Drive more foot traffic with Local campaigns</strong><br /><br />Whether they start their research on YouTube or Google, people still make the majority of their purchases in physical stores. In fact, mobile searches for “near me” have grown over 3X in the past two years<sup>4</sup>, and almost 80 percent of shoppers will go in store when there’s an item they want immediately.<sup>5</sup> For many of you, that means driving foot traffic to your brick-and-mortar locations is critical—especially during key moments in the year, like in-store events or promotions.<br /><br />Today we’re introducing <strong>Local campaigns</strong>: a new campaign type designed to drive <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6100636" target="_blank">store visits</a> exclusively. Provide a few simple things—like your business locations and ad creative—and Google automatically optimizes your ads across properties to bring more customers into your store.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto margin-right: auto text-align: center "><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center "><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDQESQa2ZFg/W0PfG7f2REI/AAAAAAAADaw/rkZLwIQlwX86NPyw9LzwA1ENYF6Mi54wACLcBGAs/s1600/business%2Blocations.jpg" style="margin-left: auto margin-right: auto "><img border="0" height="640" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDQESQa2ZFg/W0PfG7f2REI/AAAAAAAADaw/rkZLwIQlwX86NPyw9LzwA1ENYF6Mi54wACLcBGAs/s640/business%2Blocations.jpg" width="472" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center "><em>Show your business locations across Google properties and networks</em></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Local campaigns will roll out to advertisers globally over the coming months.<br /><br /><strong>Get the most from your Shopping campaigns</strong><br /><br />Earlier this year, we rolled out a <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/7674739" target="_blank">new Shopping campaign type</a> that optimizes performance based on your goals. These&nbsp <strong>Smart Shopping campaign</strong> help you hit your revenue goals without the need to manually manage and bid to individual products. In the coming months, we’re improving them to <strong>optimize across multiple business goals</strong>.<br /><br />Beyond <strong>maximize conversion value</strong>, you’ll also be able to select <strong>store visits</strong> or <strong>new customers</strong> as goals. Machine learning factors in the likelihood that a click will result in any of these outcomes and helps adjust bids accordingly.<br /><br />Machine learning is also used to optimize where your Shopping ads show—on Google.com, Image Search, YouTube and millions of sites and apps across the web—and which products are featured. It takes into account a wide range of signals, like seasonal demand and pricing. Brands like <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/case_study_gittigidiyor_smart_shopping_campaigns.pdf" target="_blank">GittiGidiyor</a>, an eBay company, are using Smart Shopping campaigns to simplify how they manage their ads and deliver better results. GittiGidiyor was able to increase return on ad spend by 28 percent and drive 4 percent more sales, while saving time managing campaigns.<br /><br />We’re also adding support for leading e-commerce platforms to help simplify campaign management. In the coming weeks, you’ll be able to set up and manage Smart Shopping campaigns right from Shopify, in addition to Google Ads.<br /><br /><strong>Tune in to see more</strong><br /><br />This is an important moment for marketers and we’re excited to be on this journey with you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmfaZV96x7A" target="_blank">Tune in</a> at 9am PT (12pm ET) today to see it all unfold at Google Marketing Live.<br /><br />For the latest news, follow the new <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/" target="_blank">Google Ads blog</a>.

But we all know having great technology is only part of the solution. You also need people with the expertise and knowledge to fully take advantage of everything the technology enables. It’s not unlike relying on Sherpas to help guide you from basecamp to the summit. You may be able to make the ascent on your own, but engaging a team of experts with a track record of success greatly improves your chances of making the summit. That’s why we’re excited to announce <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/partners/?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=et&amp utm_campaign=gmp-partners" target="_blank">Google Marketing Platform Partners</a>, a new program designed to ensure you have access to all the resources you need to get the most value from Google Marketing Platform.<br /><br /><strong>A robust ecosystem of skilled practitioners and companies</strong><br /><br />More than just a replacement for the existing programs, Google Analytics Certified Partners and the DoubleClick Certified Marketing Partners, the new program is designed to provide a robust ecosystem of resources, no matter your needs. The foundation of the program is scaled training and capability-building across all the Google Marketing Platform products. Whether you’re looking to build skills in-house or partner with a service provider, the program helps ensure the needed skills and resources are readily available. With more than 500 companies in the program at launch, including leading interactive agencies, system integrators, and top technology, data and media companies, you’ll be able to find a partner to support multiple facets of your business.<br /><br /><strong>Three unique designations</strong><br /><br />From skill-building to broader, strategic partnerships and technology reselling, the program is designed to deliver the range and quality of expertise you expect:<br /><br /><strong>Certified Individuals:</strong> To help increase the talent pool available supporting the Google Marketing Platform, individuals will be able to access a growing library of self-study materials and complete individual product certifications. Successful completion signals an individual’s expertise with specific Google Marketing Platform products.<br /><strong>Certified Companies:</strong> Certified Companies provide consulting, training, implementation, operations and technical support services for Google Marketing Platform. These companies not only have individuals certified in one or more products, but they have a high level of knowledge, practical and industry experience, as well as stellar customer references.

2018-06-27T00:02:00.000-04:00;Introducing Google Marketing Platform;The online world was very different when DoubleClick debuted in 1996. Things we take for granted today, like texting emoji, sharing funny YouTube videos, or taking smartphone selfies were all years away. <br /><br />Of course, changes in technology have meant changes for digital marketers. There’s been an explosion of channels, formats and data. Consumers are also more aware of how they’re being marketed to and how their data is being used—and they want more control. <br /><br />To address these new realities, marketers need tools that make it easy to get better results from their marketing in a way that puts privacy first. <br /><br />This is why we’re announcing <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=et&amp utm_campaign=introducing-google-marketing-platform">Google Marketing Platform</a>. <center><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V3XP5tZi5VM/WymL6Zi8i4I/AAAAAAAALrA/p06t0l4S5dk8ceIGfL298bTi-2f5pQBEwCLcBGAs/s1600/GMP_Logo_Animation_Loop.gif" /></center> Google Marketing Platform brings together DoubleClick Digital Marketing and the Google Analytics 360 Suite to help you plan, buy, measure and optimize digital media and customer experiences in one place. Google Marketing Platform helps you deliver more relevant and effective marketing, while ensuring that you respect your customers’ privacy and give them control over their data. <center><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oAyMPdidZKA/Wy18795evPI/AAAAAAAALtQ/2L2W9J-NYfEcEDLL7GQnmSod1Y0Mjw-sgCLcBGAs/s800/Google%2BMarketing%2BPlatform.png" /></center> In our recent <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/resources/bain-report-how-top-brands-grow-with-timely-customer-connections?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=et&amp utm_campaign=introducing-google-marketing-platform">survey</a> of global marketing organizations, we learned that the #1 priority for marketers is to better understand their customers. By offering tools that make it easy to collaborate and share insights, Google Marketing Platform helps achieve this customer-first approach to marketing. <br /><br />In the U.S., adidas has started working more collaboratively across their digital teams to share insights and get a deeper understanding of their customers. Chris Murphy, Head of Digital Experience, describes their approach: <br /><br /><blockquote>“Our adidas teams work together in one environment where we can see audience insights, what creative we’re running and where, how it’s performing, and make changes almost in real time.”<br /><font size="-1">Chris Murphy, Head of Digital Experience, adidas</font> </blockquote><br /><center></center> <br /> <h3>Better results with ads plus analytics</h3> Google Marketing Platform builds on existing integrations between the Google Analytics 360 Suite and DoubleClick advertiser products. Marketers have seen great results when they use ads and analytics technology together. For example, BookIt used Analytics 360 to uncover insights about the types of travelers interested in their brand and used these insights to create more relevant campaigns in Display & Video 360. The result was a <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/resources/bookit-moves-new-users-through-funnel-using-insights-driven-creative/?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=et&amp utm_campaign=introducing-google-marketing-platform">20 percent increase in revenue</a>. <br /><br />Now, with Google Marketing Platform, we’re introducing ways to make our products work even better together. For example, the new Integration Center helps you discover and easily setup valuable connections between products.  <center><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xfOJ_1VoX1A/Wy15kKbryzI/AAAAAAAALs0/jtRZWjvZzo8OjuBiN1OZUEZR05aKCKRKgCLcBGAs/s640/Google-Marketing-Platform-Integration-Center.jpg" /></center> Google Marketing Platform also supports 100+ integrations with exchanges, measurement solutions, and other technology providers. In short, you can choose what media you buy, how you buy it, and how you measure it. <br /><br /><h3>Search Ads 360 and Display & Video 360</h3> With Google Marketing Platform, we’re also making changes to some of our advertising products. <br /><br />Search Ads 360 is the new name for DoubleClick Search. Search Ads 360 will continue to help you plan, buy, and measure your search campaigns on Google and other search engines. <br /><br />Display & Video 360 brings together features from our display advertising products: DoubleClick Bid Manager, Campaign Manager, Studio and Audience Center. Display & Video 360 allows you to execute ad campaigns end-to-end in one place, creating efficiency in how you work and helping your teams do more together. <br /><br />Don’t worry, Campaign Manager and other DoubleClick products aren’t going anywhere right away. We’ll gradually transition customers to Display & Video 360 as additional features become available. <br /><br /><h3>Looking ahead</h3> This is just the beginning of the next chapter in our platforms story. We’re committed to building solutions that help you achieve your marketing goals while meeting consumers' high expectations for privacy, transparency and control. <br /><br />We’ll be sharing more about Google Marketing Platform and Display & Video 360 at Google Marketing Live. <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/gml2018-livestream?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=et&amp utm_campaign=introducing-google-marketing-platform">Sign up</a> to watch the live streamed keynote on July 10, 9:00 a.m. PT / 12:00 p.m. ET. <br /><br /> <span class="byline-author">Posted by Brad Bender, Vice President of Display and Video Advertising</span><div class="feedflare">. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=wC1nZGp0wow:JgAAOkS3APc:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=wC1nZGp0wow:JgAAOkS3APc:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?i=wC1nZGp0wow:JgAAOkS3APc:-BTjWOF_DHI" /></a>. </div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~4/wC1nZGp0wow" width="1" />;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~3/wC1nZGp0wow/introducing-google-marketing-platform.html
2018-06-27T00:00:00.000-04:00;Introducing simpler brands and solutions for advertisers and publishers;We launched AdWords nearly 18 years ago with a simple goal—to make it easier for people to connect online with businesses. A search for <a href="https://www.google.com/retail/success-stories/#?modal_active=ss-yt-s0qTI41cZJQ">eco-friendly stationery</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWnOF68HNMk&amp list=PLA7tOCrVkffs0USfu-T0eLFgfrdwKtjWr">quilting supplies</a>, or for a service like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDKYXDZdFU4&amp t=1s">treehouse builder</a> gave us an opportunity to deliver valuable ads that were useful and relevant in the moment. That idea was the start of our first advertising product, and led to the ads business we have today. <br /><br />A lot has changed since then. Mobile is now a huge part of our everyday lives. People quickly switch from searching for products, to watching videos, browsing content, playing games and more. As a result, marketers have more opportunities to reach consumers across channels, screens and formats. The opportunity has never been more exciting, but it’s also never been more complex. Over the years, Google ads have evolved from helping marketers connect with people on Google Search, to helping them connect at every step of the consumer journey through text, video, display and more.  <br /><br />  That’s why today we are introducing simpler brands and solutions for our advertising products: Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform, and Google Ad Manager. These new brands will help advertisers and publishers of all sizes choose the right solutions for their businesses, making it even easier for them to deliver valuable, trustworthy ads and the right experiences for consumers across devices and channels. As part of this change, we are releasing new solutions that help advertisers get started with Google Ads and drive greater collaboration across teams.  <br /><br /><h3>Google AdWords is becoming Google Ads</h3> <br />The new Google Ads brand represents the full range of advertising capabilities we offer today—on Google.com and across our other properties, partner sites and apps—to help marketers connect with the billions of people finding answers on Search, watching videos on YouTube, exploring new places on Google Maps, discovering apps on Google Play, browsing content across the web, and more.  <center><img border="0" height="292" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--jQwpNW00L0/WzMQFghA7LI/AAAAAAAALvY/UVqpIbvQtxQdt3i_ljbwc2mAc7s0e4E7ACLcBGAs/s400/GAds-Logo-Animation_wTitles.gif" width="400" /></center> For small businesses specifically, we’re introducing a new campaign type in Google Ads that makes it easier than ever to get started with online advertising. It brings the machine learning technology of Google Ads to small businesses and helps them get results without any heavy lifting—so they can stay focused on running their businesses.

Google Marketing Platform helps marketers achieve their goals by building on existing integrations between the Google Analytics 360 Suite and DoubleClick Digital Marketing. The platform helps marketers plan, buy, measure and optimize digital media and customer experiences in one place.

Display & Video 360 brings together features from DoubleClick Bid Manager, Campaign Manager, Studio and Audience Center to allow creative, agency, and media teams to collaborate and execute ad campaigns end-to-end in a single place. We’ll share more details about Display & Video 360 in the coming weeks, including a demo during the keynote at Google Marketing Live. <br /><br /><h3>Google Ad Manager: A unified platform</h3><br />We recognize that the way publishers monetize their content has changed. With people accessing content on multiple screens, and with advertisers’ growing demand for programmatic access, publishers need to be able to manage their businesses more simply and efficiently. That’s why for the last three years, we’ve been working to bring together DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange in a complete and unified programmatic platform under a new name–<a href="https://admanager.google.com/home?utm_medium=ga-blog&amp utm_source=et&amp utm_campaign=new-advertising-brands">Google Ad Manager</a>.  <center><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b0qHITRkK30/WyqWXzQBgyI/AAAAAAAALrc/F85Z02p4I74dQrBzd-IzZE4_d0cTDR2ggCLcBGAs/s1600/_DFP%252BAdX%253DAdMan-2e.gif" /></center> With this evolution, we’re excited to do even more for our partners—earning them more money, more efficiently, wherever people are watching videos, playing games or engaging with content, and however advertisers are looking to work with them. To learn more, visit the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admanager/introducing-google-ad-manager?utm_medium=ga-blog&amp utm_source=et&amp utm_campaign=new-advertising-brands">Google Ad Manager blog</a>. <br /><br /><h3>Transparency and controls people can trust</h3><br />We know that the media and technology advertisers and publishers choose to use impacts the relationships they have with their customers. As always, our commitment is to ensure that all of our products and platforms set the industry’s highest standard in giving people transparency and choice in the ads they see. For example, we recently <a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/ads/greater-transparency-and-control-over-your-google-ad-experience">announced new Ads Settings and expanded Why this ad?</a> across all of our services, and almost all websites and apps that partner with us to show ads. <br /><br />You'll start to see the new Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform and Google Ad Manager brands over the next month. <br /><br />We’ll be sharing more about these changes—and many other new Ads, Analytics and Platforms solutions designed to help you grow your business—at Google Marketing Live. <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/gml2018-livestream/?utm_medium=ga-blog&amp utm_source=et&amp utm_campaign=new-advertising-brands">Register now</a> to watch live on July 10, 9:00 a.m. PT / 12:00 p.m. ET.    <br /><span class="byline-author"><i>Posted by Sridhar Ramaswamy, Senior Vice President, Ads & Commerce</i></span><div class="feedflare">. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=5U7KL3NV00M:j4DjePiZ6aY:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=5U7KL3NV00M:j4DjePiZ6aY:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?i=5U7KL3NV00M:j4DjePiZ6aY:-BTjWOF_DHI" /></a>. </div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~4/5U7KL3NV00M" width="1" />;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~3/5U7KL3NV00M/new-advertising-brands.html

2018-05-30T11:00:00.000-04:00;Deliver more relevant experiences with Optimize and AdWords;<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left ">Search is one of the most important acquisition channels in a marketer’s toolkit. But it’s not enough to just optimize search ads. It’s essential to consider the entire customer journey and keep people engaged once they reach your site. That’s why we introduced an integration between Optimize and AdWords to make it easy for marketers to test and create personalized landing pages.<br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left ">How Spotify boosted conversions with Optimize and AdWords </h3><div style="clear: left float: left margin-bottom: 1em margin-right: 1em "><br /></div><div style="clear: left float: left margin-bottom: 1em margin-right: 1em "><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Uzi7LwMrRAc/Ww4h-uNw2oI/AAAAAAAADZ0/W_LpdNaO1s4r5w5MiULcevOkHfa5UGDsACLcBGAs/s1600/Spotify_Logo_RGB_Green.jpg" style="clear: left float: left margin-bottom: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Uzi7LwMrRAc/Ww4h-uNw2oI/AAAAAAAADZ0/W_LpdNaO1s4r5w5MiULcevOkHfa5UGDsACLcBGAs/s320/Spotify_Logo_RGB_Green.jpg" width="200" /></a>Spotify, one of the world’s leading audio streaming services, is just one example of a company that has successfully used the Optimize and AdWords integration to drive more conversions from their search campaigns. Spotify discovered that the most streamed content in Germany was actually audiobooks, not music. So they wanted to show German users that they have a wide selection of audiobooks, and also that the experience of listening to them is even better with a premium subscription.&nbsp  <br /><br />Using the AdWords integration with Optimize 360 (the enterprise version of Optimize), Spotify ran an experiment that focused on users in Germany who had searched for "audiobooks" on Google and clicked through on their search ad. Half of these users were shown a custom landing page dedicated to audiobooks, while the other half were shown the standard page. The custom landing page increased Spotify’s premium subscriptions by 24%.&nbsp  <br /><br />”Before, it was a fairly slow process to get all these tests done. Now, with Optimize 360, we can have 20 or more tests running at the same time. It’s important that we test a lot, so it doesn’t matter if we fail as long as we keep on testing,” said Joost de Schepper, Spotify’s Head of Conversion Optimization.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><br /></div></div><br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><h3 style="text-align: left "></h3><div><br /></div><div><div style="text-align: center "><a href="https://youtu.be/_dGBMiTs4Ic" target="_blank">Watch Spotify's video case study to learn more.</a>&nbsp </div></div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "></div><br /><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left ">Driving your own results</h3><div><br /></div>Today, we’re announcing three new updates to make it easier for all marketers to realize the benefits that Spotify saw from easily testing and creating more relevant landing pages: <br /><br /><blockquote>1.

This will pull in all your AdWords accounts at once, allowing you to immediately connect data from separate campaigns, ad groups, and more. To get started, <a href="https://adwords.google.com/navi/start?flowid=awni&amp host=awn" target="_blank">switch to the new AdWords experience</a>, and then you’ll see an option to link your manager account in your Linked accounts, <a href="https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/7441215?hl=en&amp ref_topic=7310368" target="_blank">learn more</a>.<br /><br />3. Gain more flexibility with your keywords<br /><br />You can now run a single experiment for multiple keywords, even if they’re across different campaigns and ad groups. For example, test the same landing page for users that search for “chocolate chip cookies” in your “desserts” ad group and for users that search for “iced coffee” in your “beverages” ad group.</blockquote><br />With the Optimize and AdWords integration, driving results through A/B testing is fast and simple. <a href="https://optimize.google.com/?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2018-q2-gbl-all-optimize&amp utm_content=deliver-more-relevant-experiences-with-optimize-and-adwords" target="_blank">Sign-up for an Optimize account</a> at no charge and get started today.<br /><br />Happy Optimizing!<br /><br /><br /><div><span class="byline-author">Posted by Rotimi Iziduh, Product Manager, Google Optimize</span></div></div><div class="feedflare">. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=K73IVz2BAoc:HjkCALdNTyk:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=K73IVz2BAoc:HjkCALdNTyk:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?i=K73IVz2BAoc:HjkCALdNTyk:-BTjWOF_DHI" /></a>. </div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~4/K73IVz2BAoc" width="1" />;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~3/K73IVz2BAoc/deliver-more-relevant-experiences-with-optimize-and-adwords-pmm.html
2018-05-17T11:00:00.000-04:00;Introducing Advanced Analysis in Google Analytics 360;<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left ">In our conversations with marketers, we consistently hear that they are looking to gain deeper insights into the customer journey and then turn those insights into better customer experiences.&nbsp  <br /><br />Today we’re excited to announce Advanced Analysis, a new tool in beta for Google Analytics 360 customers. Advanced Analysis offers more detailed analysis techniques and deeper exploration capabilities, so you can improve your understanding of how people interact with your site and use those insights to deliver better experiences and reach your business goals.<br /><br />Our top priority is to help you discover business insights while respecting user privacy. So, as with all Analytics capabilities, data utilized in Advanced Analysis is treated confidentially and securely.<br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left ">Three ways to support sophisticated analysis</h3><br /><br />Advanced Analysis offers three new powerful techniques to help surface actionable insights about how people use your site: Exploration, Funnel Analysis, and Segment Overlap. And you can build audiences using any of the techniques, making it seamless to take action on the learnings that come out of your analysis.<br /><br />With the Exploration technique, deeper analysis can be done in just a few clicks. Easily drag and drop multiple variables (segments, dimensions, and metrics) into the analysis canvas and see instant visualizations of your data. Exploration allows you to view and compare multiple analysis tabs in a single view — helping you test and refine your insights as you go.<br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V1ckWBO16Ko/WvnDh_r8PDI/AAAAAAAADYU/4gOQNaToWUA9citdLTOYP7EjKJG_PutqwCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V1ckWBO16Ko/WvnDh_r8PDI/AAAAAAAADYU/4gOQNaToWUA9citdLTOYP7EjKJG_PutqwCLcBGAs/s1600/image1.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />Create multiple tabs and compare your analyses. </i></span></div></div>Use the Funnel Analysis technique to understand the steps users take to complete actions on your site. For example, you can quickly see how users progress through your purchase process and identify steps where it can be improved. With the current <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6180923?hl=en">Custom Funnels</a> in Analytics 360, you can add up to 5 steps (e.g. Visited Site, Added Product to Cart, Started Checkout, Started Payment, Purchased), but Advanced Analysis lets you add up to 10 steps. These extra steps - along with the ability to add multiple segments and dimension breakdowns - give you a deeper look at how different groups of people interact with your site.<br /><br />The Segment Overlap technique allows you to see how segments you’ve created in Analytics 360 intersect with one another. For example, suppose you ran a major display campaign last month that led to a lot of new first-time purchasers, and now you want to know if they’re sticking around to become repeat customers. Segment Overlap allows you to compare how much this group of first-time buyers overlaps with users who have made a purchase in the past month and with users who are now returning to your site.<br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dEtzQ7596yo/WvnUs11ao5I/AAAAAAAADYk/hrt6-qqU8wI81qEk4-QkSucfbCQ3itHhACLcBGAs/s1600/image4.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dEtzQ7596yo/WvnUs11ao5I/AAAAAAAADYk/hrt6-qqU8wI81qEk4-QkSucfbCQ3itHhACLcBGAs/s1600/image4.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />See overlap between different audience segments. </i></span></div></div><br /><h3 style="text-align: left "><b>Advanced Analysis in action</b></h3><br />Let’s review an example of how you can use these techniques together to uncover helpful new insights and put them into action. Imagine you manage an ecommerce store that sells to people around the world. You want to know if there are opportunities to improve your site experience for international customers and drive more sales.<br /><br />With Advanced Analysis, you can get those answers easily. Starting with Exploration, you organize your Analytics 360 data to show number of users and revenue by country. You realize that you have a lot of new users in India but no revenue -- so there may be an opportunity to improve the checkout process and boost conversions.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AUPi8q3p0B8/WvnWc7rskiI/AAAAAAAADYw/3OZC-owUcJMZXjCYc35wPQqIBB5qJZJtgCLcBGAs/s1600/image3.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AUPi8q3p0B8/WvnWc7rskiI/AAAAAAAADYw/3OZC-owUcJMZXjCYc35wPQqIBB5qJZJtgCLcBGAs/s1600/image3.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />Organize data by country to determine your top countries by traffic. </i></span></div></div><br />From there, you investigate further with the Funnels technique to compare conversion rates at each step of your purchase funnel for US and India users. In doing so, you see there is a steep drop in completion rate on the checkout step for the India group. This confirms what you suspected, that the checkout flow can be improved for these users.<br /><br />With just two clicks, you build an audience of India users who have added a product to their cart but didn’t purchase. Once the audience is created, you can use <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/optimize/">Optimize 360</a> to test a new checkout experience for that group. And then, with just a few more clicks in Analytics 360, you can push that audience to AdWords or DoubleClick Bid Manager to run a remarketing campaign, taking advantage of the now optimized checkout flow.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l2ttggFH8yg/WvnXfRY1RpI/AAAAAAAADY8/b9P7psmchisQj7sJYObLKCcHo7oUGtKyQCLcBGAs/s1600/image2.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l2ttggFH8yg/WvnXfRY1RpI/AAAAAAAADY8/b9P7psmchisQj7sJYObLKCcHo7oUGtKyQCLcBGAs/s1600/image2.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />Identify conversion rate drop off, and build a custom audience based on that segment.</i></span></div></div><br />For enterprises looking to better understand customer journeys, Advanced Analysis helps surface hard-to-find insights and makes it easy to put those insights into action. Advanced Analysis will be rolling out over the coming weeks as a beta to all Analytics 360 users.<br /><br />Happy analyzing!<br /><br />Posted by Dan Stone, Product Manager, Google Analytics 360  <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center "><div><span><i><br /></i></span></div></div></div><div class="feedflare">. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=r-SmInzfYQk:KhPht7utvQ0:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=r-SmInzfYQk:KhPht7utvQ0:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?i=r-SmInzfYQk:KhPht7utvQ0:-BTjWOF_DHI" /></a>. </div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~4/r-SmInzfYQk" width="1" />;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~3/r-SmInzfYQk/introducing-advanced-analysis-in-google-analytics-360-pmm.html

Market research was costly and time-consuming in those days, and that made it hard for many companies to make decisions based on what their customers were actually thinking.<br /><br />Google Surveys made it easy to keep your finger on the pulse of your customers with fast, reliable insights from real people. Since then, we've continued making improvements to the product. We also launched Surveys 360, our enterprise version, with advanced targeting, reporting, and sharing features.<br /><br />And now users of both versions can reach people in more than 50 countries. Wondering if your new product line should launch in Portugal? Stop guessing and find out. Lacking competitive intel in India? Not anymore. Trying to convince your boss that your idea is better? We can help with that.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><em>"As a global company, we're especially excited about the targeting expansion to over 50 new countries.

We also know that consumers have more control of their digital environments than ever — and that they expect us to consistently make recommendations in line with their interests, personalities, and behaviors.<sup>1</sup> So how can we regularly communicate in a relevant way with all of our customers?<br /><br />According to our new report on MIT Sloan Management Review, success starts with a strategy that’s backed by data. <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/resources/report-data-driven-transformations-rethink-customer-journey.html?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2018-q1-gbl-all-ga360-suite&amp utm_content=lessons-from-leaders" target="_blank">In the report</a>, The Data-Driven Transformation, we speak with marketing leaders from Bayer, Tapestry Inc. (the parent brand for Coach, kate spade new york, and Stuart Weitzman), and Sprint. They open up with first-hand insights about transforming their teams to be more efficient, accurate, and agile. Here’s a few key insights from the research — and some words of wisdom from these top analytics pros. <br /><br /><strong>Move toward a unified technology stack — and educate as you go</strong><br /><br />A recent study by the Association of National Advertisers showed that top marketing performers are the same companies that spend the most money on marketing technology.<sup>2</sup> In many ways, their investments are paying off, but for those still using separate solutions for separate channels, there’s greater potential. Unifying their tech under a single, shared system could bring fuller, more tailored consumer insights — not to mention an easier way to evaluate what’s working and what’s not.<br /><br />Jeff Rasp, director of digital strategy for Bayer’s Consumer Health division, did just that, helping reimagine <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-fueled-marketing-team-strategy/" target="_blank">his team’s approach to data</a>. He oversaw the creation of a new marketing insights platform to consolidate data under a single customer ID, and also helped build the company’s first attribution model to evaluate their success. <br /><br /><strong>Assemble teams with the analytics skills to uncover actionable insights</strong><br /><br />To deliver the right messages at the right times, marketing organizations need data scientists, mobile developers, and other data professionals. For Rob Roy, chief digital officer at Sprint, that meant building a new in-house analytics team to take operations over from external partners. <br /><br />“We needed to get the right people who know how to build the architecture to house all the data,” Roy explains. <br /><br />Once he found them, Sprint worked to integrate data across channels — from web and social media to retail and display — allowing the team more advanced customer segmentation capabilities.<br /><br /><strong>Encourage collaboration across teams</strong><br /><br />A recent McKinsey study showed that 51% of top-performing marketers were part of a networked organization — one where cross-functional teams come together as needed. Parinaz Vahabzadeh, VP of global data labs at Tapestry, is one leader who’s made sure her team collaborates as a single unit.<br /><br />“Our mandate is to democratize the data,” explains Vahabzadeh. “As a small, centralized team, we need to find ways to focus on the most impactful projects and also enable the broader teams to run analytics independently.”<br /><br /><strong>Find out more</strong><br /><br />Want the full stories behind how these three brands are reimagining what they can do with data to reach their customers in relevant ways? <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/resources/report-data-driven-transformations-rethink-customer-journey.html?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2018-q1-gbl-all-ga360-suite&amp utm_content=lessons-from-leaders" target="_blank">Download the full report to learn more</a>. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small ">1-2 MIT SMR Custom Studio/Google, “The Data Driven Transformation,” January 2018</span><br /><br /><span class="byline-author">Posted by Matt Earp, Content Marketing Strategist, Google Analytics team</span></div><div class="feedflare">. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=YMn1DN3vhxc:uQj5jBe38d8:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=YMn1DN3vhxc:uQj5jBe38d8:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?i=YMn1DN3vhxc:uQj5jBe38d8:-BTjWOF_DHI" /></a>. </div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~4/YMn1DN3vhxc" width="1" />;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~3/YMn1DN3vhxc/lessons-from-leaders-a-data-driven-approach-mktg.html

In Analytics 360 Mango discovered that while many consumers browsed product listing pages, few were taking the next step to add products to their shopping cart. To reduce steps to checkout, Mango used Optimize 360 to include an “Add” button to product listing pages. This increased the number of users adding products to their carts by 49%.

2018-01-17T09:00:00.000-05:00;Integration of Salesforce Sales Cloud to Google Analytics 360 is now available;<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left ">In November we <a href="https://analytics.googleblog.com/2017/11/google-analytics-360-salesforce.html">announced a partnership with Salesforce</a>, including a plan to build new integrations between Google Analytics 360, Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud, seamlessly connecting sales, marketing and advertising data for the first time. <br /><br />Today we're introducing the first of these integrations: sales pipeline data from Sales Cloud (e.g. leads, opportunities) can now be imported directly into Analytics 360, so any marketer in a business that manages leads can see a more complete view of the customer’s path to conversion and quickly take action to engage them at the right moment. Enterprises such as Rackspace and Carbonite are already benefiting from this integration, saving hours piecing together data and reaching new, more valuable audiences. <br /><br /><h3>A complete view of the customer journey</h3>We often hear from marketers how difficult it is to connect online and offline customer interactions in order to see a complete view of a customer’s journey — and they also tell us how helpful it would be if they could do it successfully. Good news: with the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7584445">turnkey integration between Sales Cloud and Analytics 360</a>, marketers can now easily combine offline sales data with their digital analytics data so they can see a complete view of the conversion funnel. <br /><br />This opens up new ways to understand how customers engage with brands and how marketing programs perform. For example, marketers can explore the relationship between the traffic source for online leads (e.g. organic search vs. paid search vs. email) and the quality of those leads, as measured by how they progress through the sales pipeline. <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5JfWNOCNMJU/WlfqWvxSrEI/AAAAAAAADT8/58teObEspScSuwoAdT_9aZngbuP8wdz5gCLcBGAs/s1600/example-report.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5JfWNOCNMJU/WlfqWvxSrEI/AAAAAAAADT8/58teObEspScSuwoAdT_9aZngbuP8wdz5gCLcBGAs/s1600/example-report.png" /></a></div><i>Example of a report in Google Analytics 360 showing the relationship between the traffic source for online leads and the progression of those leads through the sales pipeline, as tracked in Salesforce</i><br /><br />With the built-in connection between Analytics 360 and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>, Google Cloud's enterprise data warehouse, marketers can also easily move Sales Cloud data from Analytics 360 into Google Cloud to join it with other datasets and unlock BigQuery's powerful set of tools for identifying insights. <br /><br /><h3>Better marketing outcomes</h3>More visibility into the customer journey is great — but the real value comes from being able to take action. For example, if one source of site traffic consistently delivers leads that are higher quality than another source, budget can be shifted to drive more of the better traffic. <br /><br />The built-in connections between Analytics 360 and Google’s media buying platforms offer additional ways to find new customers and drive incremental revenue. Marketers can use the tools in AdWords and DoubleClick Search to optimize their bidding on search ads based on the goal of actual sales (offline conversions tracked in Salesforce) rather than just basic website leads. Or they can create an audience list in Analytics 360 of qualified leads from Sales Cloud and use AdWords or DoubleClick Bid Manager so their display ads reach people with similar characteristics. <br /><br /><h3>“People are doing backflips over this”</h3><a href="http://www.rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>® is a provider of managed cloud services that relies heavily on digital marketing channels to capture interest from potential customers and drive new business. Rackspace has been beta testing the Sales Cloud to Analytics 360 integration and the team has already seen significant benefits from connecting their sales pipeline reporting to their digital marketing analytics. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UkTX4cmGmtU/WlfrreG_qrI/AAAAAAAADUI/QuSAPFcIp6U784vywjWtLhgjfTiq8gu3wCLcBGAs/s1600/rackspace.png" style="clear: left float: left margin-bottom: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" height="96" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UkTX4cmGmtU/WlfrreG_qrI/AAAAAAAADUI/QuSAPFcIp6U784vywjWtLhgjfTiq8gu3wCLcBGAs/s320/rackspace.png" width="320" /></a></div>“Being able to easily see our sales pipeline data in Google Analytics and get complete funnel reports with no manual work has been a game changer. We’re now able to quickly diagnose changes in lead volume and quality, and trace them back to our marketing investments in a way that was not possible before. <br /><br />We’re getting better insights into our marketing performance and getting those insights much more quickly than when we were trying to stitch this together manually — saving 8-10 hours each week and reducing the lag from importing offline conversion data from 4-6 weeks to virtually real-time. People are doing backflips over this!” - Lara Indrikovs, Senior Manager, Digital Insights & Analytics <br /><br /><a href="http://www.carbonite.com">Carbonite</a> offers cloud data back-up services that help protect personal and business data from data loss. Carbonite has also been beta testing the Sales Cloud integration and is gearing up to change their media activation strategy to take advantage of the new insights that are now available to them. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MXbe44sOgUw/WlfsArNQU9I/AAAAAAAADUM/SBN2JHgYOyAcwz1JemZe6-HHICT80UAaACLcBGAs/s1600/carbonite.png" style="clear: left float: left margin-bottom: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" height="42" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MXbe44sOgUw/WlfsArNQU9I/AAAAAAAADUM/SBN2JHgYOyAcwz1JemZe6-HHICT80UAaACLcBGAs/s320/carbonite.png" width="320" /></a></div>“We’re really excited about the opportunity to leverage Salesforce data in Google Analytics and our AdWords media campaigns. This will allow us to activate pipeline acceleration and lookalike prospecting campaigns based on the profiles of companies that achieved key milestones in our customer lifecycle after becoming a lead. We expect this new approach will improve our ROI by shifting our targeting capabilities towards more valuable leads and opportunities.” - Norman Guadagno, SVP of Marketing <br /><br /><h3>What's next?</h3>Over the next few months we’ll be making additional Sales Cloud data available in Analytics 360, giving marketers even more intelligence. For example: <ul><li>Product-specific data will make it possible to run remarketing campaigns that present cross-sell or up-sell offers to customers based on products previously ordered</li><li>Data predicting the likelihood of lead conversion will let marketers create audience lists of prospects who have a high likelihood of purchasing, which can be used for remarketing (to move people along the sales funnel) or prospecting</li><li>Lifetime value data can be used as a diagnostic tool to provide insight into which marketing channel brings in the highest value customers</li></ul><br /><br />As 2018 moves on, we'll continue to roll out more of the Salesforce-Analytics 360 integrations announced back in November. Soon marketers will be able to include conversion data from Sales Cloud in Google Attribution 360 for more accurate data-driven attribution modeling, surface data from Analytics 360 in Marketing Cloud for a more complete understanding of campaign performance, and make audiences created in Analytics 360 available in Marketing Cloud for activation via direct marketing channels like email. <br /><br />Contact us <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/contact-us/?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=referral-internal&amp utm_campaign=2017-all-ga360-analytics">here</a> if you are not yet using Analytics 360 and would like to learn more. Current customers can talk to your account team or Certified Analytics Partner about developing a plan for implementing these integrations. <br /><br /> Stay tuned, it's going to be a big year! <br /><span class="byline-author">Kyle Harrison, Group Product Manager, Google Analytics</span></div><div class="feedflare">. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=t6gd01bM0CY:na1J10dc4oE:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" /></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?a=t6gd01bM0CY:na1J10dc4oE:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img border="0" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/tRaA?i=t6gd01bM0CY:na1J10dc4oE:-BTjWOF_DHI" /></a>. </div><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~4/t6gd01bM0CY" width="1" />;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/tRaA/~3/t6gd01bM0CY/integration-salesforce-sales-cloud.html

They start with something slower: simple curiosity. They grow from “what if” to the seeds of an idea and, if you’re lucky, into some big next steps.<br /><br />Many people on your team might also have these “what if” ideas too. For example, maybe they’ve got an insight about how to optimize your marketing plans and drive better results. But they might need a little nudge to turn those ideas into something bigger. For your organization to consistently get from insight to action, it’s important to give people at <em>all</em> levels the skills and training they need to explore their hunches using data. After all, you never know where your <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/marketing-data-analysis-infographic" target="_blank">company’s next great idea might come from</a>.<br /><br />Here are three ways you can spread your data expertise to others, helping people beyond just a small team of go-to analytics experts.<br /><br /><strong>1. Make training a priority</strong><br /><br />By analyzing the data that drives your business, anyone on your team can uncover how, when, and where consumers interact with your brand. That helps spread a deeper understanding of the customer journey throughout your organization. But to get there, you’ll need support to make data and analytics a priority — from the top down. In a <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-strategy-technology-marketing-analytics" target="_blank">recent study</a> conducted by Google and Econsultancy, nearly two-thirds of leading organizations said that their executives treat data-driven insights as more valuable than gut instinct.<sup>1</sup><br /><br />One way to have an impact? Help executives create a training plan by determining what your team needs to know in order to analyze the data they’ve collected. By identifying the gaps between what they already know and what they still need to learn, you’ll have the insights you need to provide your team with the right level of training. Once you run a training session, record it and keep it online for later use, and share it with anyone who couldn’t make the meeting.<br /><br /><strong>2. Share your success</strong><br /><br />If you’re a go-to data expert on your team, sharing your success is one of the most powerful tools you have to spread data literacy. Look for time to <a href="https://analytics.googleblog.com/2017/02/what-does-good-website-test-look-like.html?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2017-q4-gbl-all-ga360-suite&amp utm_content=turn-data-curiosity-into-results">recap the results of a recent A/B test</a> and show your team members how you achieved results. That will get them excited about what they can do with data. Also, don’t be shy — at every opportunity, recognize and reward others you see using data effectively. This helps build enthusiasm. Finally, use your knowledge and demonstrate proven business results to communicate what data can do.<br /><br />As an analyst, you may even want to start thinking of your role in a new light. Analysts don’t just pull reports — they <a href="http://analytics.googleblog.com/2017/03/why-your-testing-and-optimization-team.html?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2017-q4-gbl-all-ga360-suite&amp utm_content=turn-data-curiosity-into-results">weave data narratives and interpret how data influences</a> business results. That brings data to life and shows its value to the whole team. By sharing openly, you’ll give colleagues the tools they need to answer burning questions or dig deeper into their own hypotheses.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><em>Looking for more ways to turn everyone one your team into a data-savvy marketer? We put together <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/marketing-data-analysis-infographic" target="_blank">an infographic with 5 key steps</a> to help get you there.</em></blockquote><br /><strong>3. Work together across teams</strong><br /><br />While it might be tempting to use your data powers to make your own team shine, data is actually better when it’s used across teams. In fact, marketing leaders are <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data-collections/establishing-marketing-data-strategy-collection" target="_blank">1.6X as likely</a> as their mainstream counterparts to strongly agree that open access to data leads to higher business performance.<sup>2</sup><br /><br />You can take it one step further. Use your expertise to create and share easy-to-understand data reports outside your team. It’s a great way to help beginners make sense of recommendations and insights, and to get an idea for productive ways to use them.<br /><br />When sharing your data, make sure it’s organized and easy for all teams to access and understand. Include clear definitions and common metrics so that everyone is on the same page. To go above and beyond, tailor insights specifically for different teams. That way they can get a deeper understanding of the report’s value. And don’t forget to consider the ways in which you deliver the data — every team has its own preferred channels for communicating.<br /><br />Finally, don’t stop reaching out once you’ve worked to <a href="https://analytics.googleblog.com/2017/08/three-ways-to-get-data-out-of-silos-mktg.html?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2017-q4-gbl-all-ga360-suite&amp utm_content=turn-data-curiosity-into-results" target="_blank">break down data silos</a> in your company. It takes continued, active steps to keep data flowing across an organization.<br /><br />With training in data analytics, every member of your team can support big ideas with real data. That helps ensure those ideas are taken seriously.

That's why <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/?utm_source=ga-blog&amp utm_medium=blog&amp utm_campaign=2017-q4-gbl-all-ga&amp utm_content=new-ways-to-measure-your-users-in-google-analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> keeps working to better measure the full customer journey in all its complexity.<br /><br />Let's look at four new Analytics features that are all about helping businesses understand users so they can deliver more personalized site experiences.<br /><br /><h3>Focus on your users in reporting&nbsp </h3><br />Analytics standard reports have been updated to focus on your <strong>users</strong>. User metrics are an essential way to understand engagement with your customers, especially those who may have multiple sessions across multiple days.<br /><br />With our updated standard reporting, you can see immediately, for instance, how many users are coming to your site from paid search ― in addition to seeing the number of sessions.  <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Tm06mEnDvUA/WjGhOMbavGI/AAAAAAAADSg/3-PCnkaWPQoUw_rxkSdHmhbP-n9FjctIACLcBGAs/s640/users%2Bin%2Breporting.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Tm06mEnDvUA/WjGhOMbavGI/AAAAAAAADSg/3-PCnkaWPQoUw_rxkSdHmhbP-n9FjctIACLcBGAs/s640/users%2Bin%2Breporting.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />Users are now included in Analytics standard reports.</i></span></div></div><br /><br />To enable this update, sign in to your account and go to Admin &gt Property Settings and then choose the toggle switch labeled <em>Enable Users In Reporting</em>.<br /><br />For other ways to analyze by user, try existing reports like <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6171863" target="_blank">Active Users</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6074676" target="_blank">Cohort Analysis</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6182550" target="_blank">Lifetime Value</a>. In case you're wondering, session metrics will continue to be available in standard reporting ― that's not changing. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/1007027" target="_blank">Learn more about audience reports.</a><br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left ">Measure lifetime metrics and dimensions for every user&nbsp </h3><br />Another tool that marketers can use to analyze visitors on an individual level is <strong>User Explorer</strong>. And now we've added something new: lifetime metrics and dimensions for individual users (based on the lifetime of their <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage" target="_blank">cookie</a>). These new metrics and dimensions will give Analytics users a much more detailed way to measure visitors and customers.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y1ggaclaa1w/WjGitY8uogI/AAAAAAAADSs/ikXPRrKhebQnhUnpqhgmgTW-1Lg4KFLjgCLcBGAs/s1600/lifetimevalue.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y1ggaclaa1w/WjGitY8uogI/AAAAAAAADSs/ikXPRrKhebQnhUnpqhgmgTW-1Lg4KFLjgCLcBGAs/s1600/lifetimevalue.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />New lifetime metrics and dimensions for individual users in User Explorer.</i></span></div></div><br />For example, you can look back and see the total amount of time an individual user has spent or the total number of transactions an individual user has made on your website. You'll also see new dimensions that show data such as when a user made their first visit to your site and which channel acquired them.<br /><br />The new lifetime metrics and dimensions are already available in your Analytics account. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6339208" target="_blank">Learn more about User Explorer.</a><br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left ">Audiences in reporting&nbsp </h3><br />For marketers who live and breathe audiences ― which is most of us ― the breathing just got easier. We've added the option to publish any audience to a new report in Analytics that should help make every audience easier to understand. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CLp-Jc5KdN0/WjGjK1Wp6wI/AAAAAAAADSw/w8bitBe2_BcpYucVJVwfPmJejbpXs6AtQCLcBGAs/s1600/audiences%2Bin%2Breporting.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CLp-Jc5KdN0/WjGjK1Wp6wI/AAAAAAAADSw/w8bitBe2_BcpYucVJVwfPmJejbpXs6AtQCLcBGAs/s1600/audiences%2Bin%2Breporting.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />Publish your audiences into Analytics and then view reporting in the Audiences report.</i></span></div></div> <br /><br />You can now go to the new Audiences report and see a cross-channel view of the audiences you’ve created in Analytics. This is a change from the past, where you could create audiences in Analytics and export those audiences to other products like AdWords, but you weren’t able to publish audiences to Analytics for reporting.<br /><br />For instance, you might decide to publish an audience to Analytics so that you can see all users who have purchased within the last 12 months but not during the last 2.<br /><br />You can find the new Audience report in your Analytics account. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7162572" target="_blank">Learn more about Audiences in reporting.</a><br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left ">Reach users most likely to convert&nbsp </h3><br />Meet our newest metric: <strong>Conversion Probability</strong>. It takes user-based metrics one step further to show you just what the name suggests: the probability that a given user will convert in the future. The calculation is based on a machine learning model that learns from users who have made transactions in the past. <br /><br />The advantages are clear: Marketers can create remarketing lists that target users who have a high likelihood to purchase and then reach those users through either advertising campaigns in AdWords and DoubleClick or site experiments in Optimize.<br /><br />We are also adding a new <strong>Conversion Probability report</strong>. This report will show you the Conversion Probability for all your users, including across important dimensions such as channel.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center "><div class="separator" style="clear: both text-align: center "><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pRNllZugnAM/WjGkCfsZooI/AAAAAAAADS8/zlPvyD6Z-J8BmhVE_ToRizhb68JoGRCDgCLcBGAs/s1600/conversion%2Bprobability.png" style="margin-left: 1em margin-right: 1em "><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pRNllZugnAM/WjGkCfsZooI/AAAAAAAADS8/zlPvyD6Z-J8BmhVE_ToRizhb68JoGRCDgCLcBGAs/s1600/conversion%2Bprobability.png" /></a></div><div><span><i><br />The new conversion probability report.</i></span></div></div> <br />This new feature from <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7411707" target="_blank">Analytics Intelligence</a> is the first forward-looking estimate of how likely a conversion is for individual users. It's rolling out in beta to all Analytics accounts over the next few months. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7551092" target="_blank">Learn more about Conversion Probability.&nbsp </a><br /><br />These four new enhancements will help you better understand your users and what they are doing on your site, so that you can create better experiences for them. If you — like those 90% of marketing executives — are working hard to understand your users' journeys, we hope you'll find these features useful.<br /><br />Happy analyzing! <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small "><sup><br /></sup></span><span style="font-size: x-small "><sup>1</sup>"The Customer Experience is Written in Data."
