Wed, 02 Dec 2020 09:00:56 +0200;ITP Debug Mode in Safari;Intelligent Tracking Prevention is the name of the tracking prevention mechanism implemented in WebKit and enabled in Safari and all major browsers running on the iOS platform. I&rsquo ve written about it on this blog, and the CookieStatus.com resource is something you should bookmark for further reading.. The purpose of ITP is to prevent tracking tools&rsquo access to data stored and processed in the browser. This involves things like blocking all third-party cookies and restricting the lifetime of first-party cookies.;https://www.simoahava.com/privacy/itp-debug-mode-in-safari/

Mon, 16 Nov 2020 07:00:51 +0200;Implementation Guide For Events In Google Analytics 4;On the surface, tracking events in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is fairly simple. Events are, after all, pretty much the only thing you can collect in GA4.. It&rsquo s easy to get tied down with endless comparisons to Universal Analytics, though. While I&rsquo m steadfastly opposed to the idea that GA4 should resemble Universal Analytics, it&rsquo s still important to cleanse the palate and approach GA4&rsquo s event tracking with an open mind.. There are some comparisons that can be drawn between the new and the old, but what GA4 might lack in some features and use cases, it more than makes up for this with a more flexible data structure.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/implementation-guide-events-google-analytics-4/

Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:00 +0300;Partial Container Export In Google Tag Manager;Exporting a container in Google Tag Manager can have many purposes. From backing up Google Tag Manager versions to creating and distributing repositories of useful container snapshots, the container export is one of the most useful non-tagging-related tools that the GTM user interface offers.. However, one big misgiving in the feature (until now) has been that exporting just a subset of the container version or workspace has been impossible. It&rsquo s always the entire container or nothing.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/partial-container-export-google-tag-manager/

Wed, 26 Aug 2020 09:00:17 +0300;#GTMTips: Utilize App Engine Headers In Server-side Tagging;When you create a Server container in Google Tag Manager, GTM creates an App Engine deployment in the Google Cloud Platform for you.. App Engine is a managed serverless platform, which basically means it&rsquo s a (set of) virtual machine(s) running in the cloud, with some extra bells and whistles added to make managing it easier.. A potentially useful thing that App Engine does is decorate all incoming HTTP requests with some HTTP headers that can be used in the app.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/utilize-app-engine-headers-server-side-tagging/
Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:52:51 +0300;#GTMTips: Get True IP Anonymization With Server-side Tagging;Since the release of Server-side tagging in Google Tag Manager, I&rsquo ve jumped at every opportunity to celebrate the tools it provides for improving end-user privacy and data security.. One of the biggest benefits is obfuscation-by-default. Since all hits are passed through the server-side proxy, the default view for any third-party tool (such as Google Analytics) is that of the server in the Google Cloud rather than the browser and device with which the user was browsing the site.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/get-true-ip-anonymization-server-side-tagging/
Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:04:01 +0300;The FPID Cookie For Google Analytics In Server-side Tagging;With Server-side tagging, the developer community has a chance to vastly improve the data collection capabilities of Google&rsquo s analytics platforms (Universal Analytics and App+Web). The ability to build our own templates is particularly potent with a Server container.. However, it&rsquo s not as if Google themselves are just sitting idly by and seeing what the community can come up with.. In the built-in Universal Analytics Client template in a Server container, there&rsquo s an option to migrate to a Server Managed Client ID.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fpid-cookie-google-analytics-server-side-tagging/

This proxy comes in the shape of a new Client custom template, which takes the incoming /collect requests and sends them to Google Analytics. While doing so, it also returns the _ga cookie in a Set-Cookie header, thus preventing Safari&rsquo s Intelligent Tracking Prevention from capping its expiration to just 7 days..

These libraries all end up doing the same thing: compiling a payload-rich HTTP request to an endpoint at https://www.google-analytics.com..

This is because starting with Chrome 83, third-party cookies are blocked by default in Incognito windows.. Google Tag Manager uses third-party cookies to serve browsers in Preview mode with the container draft rather than the live container.. There&rsquo s a simple workaround to make sure Preview mode continues working for any site you want to browse in Preview mode.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/fix-preview-google-chrome-incognito-mode/

It&rsquo s a popular concept with web components, as it allows for encapsulation of web structures so that they aren&rsquo t affected by style declarations of the parent tree, for example..  However, being such a &ldquo hidden&rdquo structure, anything that happens in the shadow DOM is also hidden from Google Tag Manager&rsquo s listeners.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-interactions-in-shadow-dom-google-tag-manager/

Mon, 09 Mar 2020 09:00:40 +0200;Send Hits To The Past With Google Analytics;One of the hard-and-fast rules in Google Analytics is that once hits have been collected and processed into your data properties, those hits are untouchable. This means that if you mistakenly collect duplicate or incorrect transactions, PII traffic, or referral spam, for example, it&rsquo s extremely difficult, if not downright impossible, to purge or change this data in Google Analytics.. Another staple of Google Analytics&rsquo strict schema is that displacing hits in time is also very difficult.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/send-hits-past-google-analytics/
Mon, 02 Mar 2020 09:00:00 +0200;Create Slack Notification System For Google Tag Manager Changes;Until recently, I had a feature on GTM Tools that polled the user&rsquo s Google Tag Manager container(s) for a recently published version. If one was found, a notification was sent to a Slack app, which forwarded it to a workspace and channel of the user&rsquo s choice.. This was fine, except for the fact that polling the GTM and Slack APIs for dozens upon dozens of containers is a total resource hog, and the only way I can maintain GTM Tools is it doesn&rsquo t have API leaks like that.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/create-slack-notification-system-google-tag-manager-changes/

Loading a third-party JavaScript library is trivial to do with a Custom HTML tag, and works like a charm.. However, using Custom HTML tags for, well, anything, is no longer the preferred way to add custom code to the site. Custom HTML tags are pretty expensive DOM injections, and they can be incredibly dangerous tools (for UX, security, and privacy) in the wrong and/or inexperienced hands.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cdnjs-hosted-libraries-template-google-tag-manager/

Also, the SDK now handles API request caching to browser storage automatically, so the &ldquo Enable Session Storage&rdquo option was added to the template..

Sun, 07 Jul 2019 11:49:15 +0300;How To Build A Google Tag Manager Monitor;Google Tag Manager is strictly a tag delivery system, and it&rsquo s very careful not to collect any analytics data on its own. This is most likely a deliberate choice, because if GTM was to start collecting data, it would introduce additional barriers to adoption.. Nevertheless, being a tool that consolidates the design, development, deployment, and testing of all the marketing and analytics pixels, code snippets, and utilities running on a website or a mobile app, lacking the necessary features for auditing and monitoring has always seemed like an oversight.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-monitor/

Thu, 25 Apr 2019 12:00:56 +0300;#GTMTips: Fetch The Latest Value Of A Data Layer Variable;One of Google Tag Manager&rsquo s oldest and most reliable features is that it freezes the state of Data Layer variables to the moment when the trigger event occurred. Thus, any tags firing on this trigger (and any variables resolved on this trigger event) will always have access to the same value of each Data Layer variable.. However, there are situations where this is not a good thing. One is tag sequencing, and the other is a scenario where you want to run some custom code that should access the latest value of the Data Layer variable at a moment in time after the tag has already fired.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fetch-latest-value-data-layer-variable/

Tue, 26 Mar 2019 09:43:39 +0300;Trigger Groups In Google Tag Manager;Trigger Group is the newest trigger type you can add to a tag in Google Tag Manager. It allows you to establish dependencies between multiple triggers, not firing the tag until every trigger in the group has fired at least once..

Thu, 14 Mar 2019 09:23:07 +0200;Send Event Hits Before Pageview Hits In Google Analytics;One of the myths surrounding Google Analytics is that the first hit of a session should always be a pageview. It makes sense - sessions are initialized with a landing page, and thus need a page view to have one..  However, in this article I want to show you empirically how this myth is just that - a myth.. There is little discernible impact if the first hit of a session is an event, and GA is more than capable of stitching the first event together with the subsequent pageview into a session entity.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/send-event-before-pageview-in-google-analytics/

If it returns a number, for example, passing a parameter to it would make no sense and would result in a TypeError since the variable resolves to a number, not a function.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/create-utility-variables-returning-functions/

Fri, 04 Jan 2019 10:46:43 +0200;Prevent Duplicate Transactions In Google Analytics With customTask;One of the big problems in Google Analytics&rsquo data model is the immutability of historical data. Once a row of data is written into the data table, it is there practically for good. This is especially annoying in two cases: spam and bogus ecommerce hits. The first is a recognized issue with an open and public data collection protocol, the latter is an annoyance that can explode into full-blown sabotage (you can use the Measurement Protocol to send hundreds of huge transactions to your competitor&rsquo s GA property, for example).;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/prevent-google-analytics-duplicate-transactions-with-customtask/

Four years ago, I wrote an article on how to persist GTM&rsquo s dataLayer from page to page. Unfortunately, the solution was a bit clumsy, requiring you to give specific commands for the interactions, which made it really unwieldy in the long run. Google Tag Manager still doesn&rsquo t offer us a native way to persist the dataLayer array or its internal data model from one page to the other, so I thought it was about time I revisit this idea.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/persist-datalayer-across-pages/
Tue, 06 Nov 2018 10:05:27 +0200;#GTMTips: Search dataLayer For A Key-Value Pair;One of the difficulties of working with Google Tag Manager and the dataLayer structure is that GTM doesn&rsquo t preserve history of the items collected into its data model. Or, at least, it doesn&rsquo t preserve it in a manner that would let us access it.. This is typically a very niche problem, but it does surface every now and then. For example, say you wanted to query whether an event with some specific value has already been pushed into dataLayer.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/search-datalayer-for-key-value-pair/

Mon, 22 Oct 2018 09:16:15 +0300;Fire GTM Tag Upon Scroll Depth And Time Spent;Over 5 years ago, I wrote an article titled Track Adjusted Bounce Rate In Universal Analytics. It basically explored a number of different methods to tweak the Bounce Rate metric so that it becomes more meaningful in your Google Analytics reports.. Now, writing that article wasn&rsquo t necessarily my proudest moment. It&rsquo s not because the solution was poor, but rather because I was suggesting it makes sense to tweak a metric. The concept of &ldquo adjusted Bounce Rate&rdquo sounds like the analyst is fixing a metric to be more beneficial to their cause, rather than fixing the business problem that caused the metric to be poor in the first place.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fire-tag-upon-scroll-depth-and-time-spent/
Tue, 16 Oct 2018 12:06:49 +0300;#GTMTips: Prevent Clicks And Form Submits From Redirecting;Google Tag Manager offers us some nice built-in triggers so that we can automatically listen for specific user interactions on the website, reacting to them however we wish, though typically it would be to fire a tag.

Wed, 19 Sep 2018 08:35:17 +0300;Enhanced Ecommerce Guide For Google Tag Manager;Enhanced Ecommerce is certainly one of the finest reporting user interface features that Google Analytics has to offer. Enhanced Ecommerce, as the name implies, is a set of dimensions, metrics, and reports, which combine to provide you with a fairly complete view into how users are interacting with your products in your webstore.

Tue, 04 Sep 2018 10:31:15 +0300;Tracking Cross-domain Iframes - Upgraded Solution;**Last updated 18 September 2020: Due to how most browsers now have third-party cookie protections in place, this solution will be very ineffective going forwards. You should instead take a look at a cookieless solution..  Some years ago, I wrote a post on how to track cross-domain iframes when using Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. That solution relied on hitCallback to decorate the iframe, and now that I look back on it, it has its shortcomings.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tracking-cross-domain-iframes-upgraded-solution/
Fri, 24 Aug 2018 11:49:23 +0300;Create And Update Google Analytics Session Timeout Cookie;In Google Analytics, the concept of a session is the key aggregation unit of all the data you work with. It&rsquo s so central to all the key metrics you use (Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, Session Duration, Landing Page), and yet there&rsquo s an underlying complexity that I&rsquo m pretty certain is unrecognized by many of GA&rsquo s users. And yet, since this idea of a session is so focal to GA (to the point of being overbearing), it&rsquo s annoying that the browser isn&rsquo t privy to any of the sessionization parameters that Google Analytics applies to the hits sent from the browser to its servers.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/create-and-update-google-analytics-session-timeout-cookie/
Thu, 23 Aug 2018 16:15:24 +0300;#GTMTips: Introducing The customTask Builder;One of the coolest features of Google Analytics and, as a consequence, Google Tag Manager is customTask. It&rsquo s a method you can use to add and execute code as the hit to Google Analytics is being generated.. I&rsquo ve written A LOT about customTask, and much of the feedback I&rsquo ve received has been around the question of how to combine all these different tricks into one customTask script. The problem is, you see, that a tag or hit can only have one customTask script attached to it, so the code within must combine all the different tricks I&rsquo ve been writing about over the past months.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/introducing-customtask-builder/
Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:26:32 +0000;customTask Builder;You can use the customTask Builder tool to create a customTask script. customTask is a method of the Google Analytics library, which lets you run JavaScript code when the hit request to Google Analytics is being built..

Wed, 08 Aug 2018 12:39:45 +0300;#GTMTips: Decorate Links And Decorate Forms Tag Types;Getting cross-domain tracking right in Google Analytics is difficult. Even if you use Google Tag Manager. There are many known issues when cross-domain tracking iframes, for example.. Google Tag Manager implements the cross-domain tracking plugin quite handily via the Universal Analytics tag template, and often the easiest way to track links and form submits is to use the Auto-Link Domains option, as described in this great series of posts on cross-domain tracking by Bounteous.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/decorate-links-decorate-forms-tags/
Fri, 03 Aug 2018 09:46:04 +0300;#GTMTips: Two Simple Data Model Tricks;One of the more difficult concepts in Google Tag Manager is the data model. In essence, the data model is what Google Tag Manager uses to populate the Data Layer variable. You might be tempted to think that it&rsquo s the same thing as the dataLayer array, but it&rsquo s not.. The data model is a representation of the keys and values you push into dataLayer. Whenever you push any key into dataLayer, GTM grabs this key and updates the corresponding key in its data model with the new value, or in the case of objects and arrays merges the old and the new value together.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/two-simple-data-model-tricks/

Today, we&rsquo ll cover a nifty trick you can use with the Element Visibility trigger in Google Tag Manager.

The use case is that you have an Element Visibility trigger firing for a number of elements all sharing the same CSS selector.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/get-position-index-of-visible-element/
Sun, 22 Jul 2018 10:14:32 +0300;#GTMTips: Tag Sequencing With Custom HTML Tags;Tag sequencing was introdced to Google Tag Manager in late 2015. Its main purpose was to facilitate the sequential firing of tags that have dependencies with each other. Due to the asynchronous nature of third-party libraries like Google Tag Manager, it&rsquo s difficult to establish an order of completion with tags that compete for their chance to fire.. Tag sequencing changed this, as it allows you to establish setup and cleanup tags - the former firing before the main tag, and the latter after.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tag-sequencing-custom-html-tags/
Sun, 15 Jul 2018 09:25:44 +0300;#GTMTips: Fire Trigger When User Is About To Leave The Page;One of the great ways to leverage Google Tag Manager in your web analytics tracking is to make use of all the possible custom events that the browser has to offer. One such event is beforeunload. It&rsquo s dispatched in the browser when the user is about to unload the page. This means, typically, that the user is about to leave the page after clicking a link, or they are about to exit the browser by either closing the tab or the entire window.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fire-trigger-when-user-about-to-leave-page/
Thu, 05 Jul 2018 11:45:21 +0300;#GTMTips: Google Tag Manager Content Security Policy;A Content Security Policy (CSP) is something you&rsquo ll configure your web server with to add an additional layer of protection, especially from harmful scripts loaded from third-party vendors. Once you have a CSP in place, all resources loaded and executed by the web page need to pass the CSP directives. For Google Tag Manager, this is very relevant. If you have a CSP in place, you will need to modify it so that Google Tag Manager functions properly.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-content-security-policy/

This time, we&rsquo ll put this wonderful mechanism to work for a very, very good cause. One of the lesser known &ldquo features&rdquo of Google Analytics is that when the payload size (the request body that is actually sent to Google Analytics with each request) goes past a certain limit, specifically 8192 bytes, the hit is aborted without warning. This can come as a surprise, because there&rsquo s no indication anywhere in Google Analytics that you are missing hits because of this.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/automatically-reduce-google-analytics-payload-length/

Have you ever had a Google Tag Manager container, where you&rsquo ve been updating your Google Analytics tags over the years? And perhaps these tags (and, today, Google Analytics Settings variables) have been updated with an ever-expanding list of Custom Dimensions? And perhaps this list of Custom Dimensions is sorted willy-nilly, because once you have 50+ rows, it just doesn&rsquo t seem like a fun thing to do to go over each row and update them so that they are sorted by Custom Dimension index?;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/sort-custom-dimensions-by-index-number/

Or, more specifically, the payload size (meaning the actual content body of the request) has a maximum.. This maximum size of the payload is 8192 bytes. This means, basically, that the entire parameter string sent to Google Analytics servers can be no longer than 8192 characters in length. The thing is, if the payload exceeds this, Google Analytics simply drops the hit.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/send-google-analytics-payload-length-as-custom-dimension/

It&rsquo s useful if you have multiple companies or organizations working on the same site, but for one reason or another (e.g. governance) you want to restrict access to your main container.

I&rsquo m using &ldquo non-standard&rdquo as a qualifier here, because I don&rsquo t have an exhaustive list of attributes that are ignored. But at least data attributes (e.g. data-id) and attributes with custom names (e.g. aria-labelledby) are either stripped out upon injection, or GTM might actually prevent you from even saving the container if the Custom HTML tag has elements with these attributes.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/add-html-elements-page-programmatically/

Unfortunately, the bulk of Google Tag Manager articles online (including those on this blog) still refer to the old interface in screenshots and instructions.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/edit-google-analytics-tag-settings/
Fri, 09 Feb 2018 09:18:42 +0200;#GTMTips: Fix Missing Page View Event And Broken Triggers;Google Tag Manager should be relatively easy to implement. Just paste the container snippet to the &lt head&gt of the page and you&rsquo re good to go! However, at some point you&rsquo ll want to configure the dataLayer structure, too (read more about dataLayer here). There are two ways to do it: the right way and the wrong way.. In this article, we&rsquo ll see what happens if you do it the wrong way, how to identify the issue, and how to fix it.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/fix-missing-page-view-broken-triggers/
Wed, 07 Feb 2018 09:00:37 +0200;Snowplow: Full Setup With Google Analytics Tracking;A recent guide of mine introduced the Google Analytics adapter in Snowplow. The idea was that you can duplicate the Google Analytics requests sent via Google Tag Manager and dispatch them to your Snowplow analytics pipeline, too. The pipeline then takes care of these duplicated requests, using the new adapter to automatically align the hits with their corresponding data tables, ready for data modeling and analysis.. While testing the new adapter, I implemented a Snowplow pipeline from scratch for parsing data from my own website.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/snowplow-full-setup-with-google-analytics-tracking/

Snowplow just introduced their latest version update, which included (among other things) an adapter for processing Google Analytics payloads. Never heard of Snowplow? It&rsquo s a collection of open-source libraries designed to let you build your own analytics pipeline, all the way from data collection, through ETL (extract, transform, load), using custom enrichments and JSON schemas, and finally into your own data warehouse, where you can then analyze the data using whatever tools you find preferable.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/automatically-fork-google-analytics-hits-snowplow/

The reason I&rsquo m writing this #GTMTips article is that I want to upgrade the solution slightly, and I want to bring it back into the spotlight. Why? Because it&rsquo s still one of the most effective ways to customize your Google Tag Manager implementation..

Mon, 15 Jan 2018 09:39:41 +0200;Static Site Search With Hugo + App Engine + Search API + Python;As the year changed to 2018, I decided to abandon WordPress, which I had been using for over 12 years as my content management system of choice. I had many reasons to do so, but the biggest motivators were the opportunity to try something new and to abandon the bloat and clutter of WordPress for a more simple, more elegant order of things. Spurred on by another adopter, Mark Edmondson, I decided to give Hugo a go (pun intended).;https://www.simoahava.com/web-development/static-site-search-google-app-engine-search-api/
Fri, 12 Jan 2018 08:32:46 +0200;New Tools Released;Over the past few weeks, I&rsquo ve been coding like crazy. The three biggest outcomes of this frenzy have been this new blog design (switched finally away from WordPress and took the plunge back into the world static sites using Hugo), a new Google Sheets add-on for managing Google Tag Manager containers and assets, and a Slack integration in GTM Tools. In this article, I&rsquo ll quickly introduce the last two, as I&rsquo m writing a separate article about the site redesign.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/new-tools-released/

It was a fun exercise, but because it relies on preventing requests on a tag-by-tag basis (using the ubiquituous customTask), it can be a chore to handle in large containers.. In this article, we&rsquo ll continue with the theme of opting out from Google Analytics tracking by leveraging a solution provided by the tool itself.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/opt-out-of-google-analytics-tracking/

Google Tag Manager makes it fairly easy to do cross-domain tracking. Basically, you list the hostnames you want to automatically decorate with linker parameters in the Auto-Link Domains field of your Page View tag, and that takes care of decorating the URLs with the necessary parameter. It&rsquo s dead easy, even if there are a bunch of traps you need to watch out for (see my post on troubleshooting cross-domain tracking issues).;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/auto-link-domains-with-regex/
Tue, 19 Dec 2017 06:50:11 +0200;Add Client ID To Custom Dimension With gtag.js;When Google released gtag.js, the new, global tracking library designed to (eventually) replace analytics.js, many Universal Analytics practitioners and users were confused (see e.g. Jeff&rsquo s great overview here). It seemed like gtag.js wasn&rsquo t really solving any immediate problem, since analytics.js had done a bang-up job with Universal Analytics tracking for all these years. However, gtag&rsquo s modus operandi is the ability to leverage the same semantic information (distributed across dataLayer!) across a number of Google products, starting with GA and AdWords.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/add-clientid-to-custom-dimension-gtag-js/
Tue, 12 Dec 2017 11:21:51 +0200;#GTMTips: Add A Load Listener To Script Elements;One of the challenges in working with Google Tag Manager (or any JavaScript-based platform for that matter) is what to do with race conditions. A race condition emerges when you have two resources competing for execution in the browser, and there is a degree of unpredictability to which &ldquo wins&rdquo the race.. A prime example is working with jQuery. It&rsquo s one of the most popular JavaScript libraries out there, and websites utilize it for a multitude of things, many useful for Google Tag Manager, too.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/add-load-listener-script-elements/

Thu, 16 Nov 2017 14:52:07 +0000;Send Event And Custom Dimension If Google Optimize Experiment Is Running;I really like Google Optimize. It has a fairly intuitive UI, setting up experiments is easy, and there&rsquo s integrations for both Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics built into the system. It&rsquo s still a JavaScript-based, client-side A/B-testing tool, so problems with flicker and asynchronous loading are ever-present (though this is somewhat mitigated by the page-hiding snippet).. One issue with the Google Analytics integration is the difficulty of creating segments for sessions where the users were actively participating in the experiment.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/send-event-custom-dimension-google-optimize-experiment-running/

Tue, 17 Oct 2017 19:11:27 +0000;The Scroll Depth Trigger In Google Tag Manager;Scroll depth tracking in web analytics is one of those things you simply must do, especially if you have a content-heavy site. Tracking scroll depth not only gives you an indication of how much users are digesting your content, but it also lets you turn meaningless metrics such as Bounce Rate into something far more useful.. If you&rsquo ve already been tracking scroll depth in Google Tag Manager, you&rsquo ve probably been using either Rob Flaherty&rsquo s brilliant Scroll Depth jQuery plugin, or Bounteous&rsquo equally ingenious Scroll Tracking recipe.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/scroll-depth-trigger-google-tag-manager/
Tue, 17 Oct 2017 19:00:02 +0000;The Element Visibility Trigger In Google Tag Manager;Holy visibility, Batman! Visibility is a seriously undervalued aspect of web analytics tracking. Too often, we fall into the trap of thinking that &ldquo Page Views&rdquo actually have something to do with &ldquo viewing&rdquo a page. Or that tracking scrolling to 25%, 50%, or 75% of vastly different pages makes sense on the aggregate level. So you will be very pleased to know that the Google Tag Manager team (who have been on FIRE recently), have just published the Element Visibility trigger.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/element-visibility-trigger-google-tag-manager/

It was accompanied by a blog post, which contained a brief look into many of Google Tag Manager&rsquo s key features, some of which are still relevant today.. Google Tag Manager is a free tool that consolidates your website tags with a single snippet of code and lets you manage everything from a web interface. You can add and update your own tags, with just a few clicks, whenever you want, without bugging the IT folks or rewriting site code.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/happy-5th-birthday-google-tag-manager/
Tue, 26 Sep 2017 14:09:49 +0000;Prevent Site Speed Sampling Rate From Skewing Custom Dimensions And Custom Metrics;Universal Analytics can collect Page Timing data from users that load your pages. This data is populated in to the Behavior -&gt Site Speed -&gt Page Timings report, and it&rsquo s a very useful feature for optimizing your website..  However, there&rsquo s a murky underside to this generous feature. The way Page Timings collection works is that when Pageview hits are sent from the site, a sample of these (1% by default) are automatically followed by a timing hit which includes page performance data grabbed from the Navigation Timing API.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/prevent-site-speed-sampling-rate-skewing-custom-dimensions-custom-metrics/
Wed, 20 Sep 2017 21:29:43 +0000;The RegEx Table Variable In Google Tag Manager;Ever since the Lookup Table variable was introduced in Google Tag Manager, users have been craving for more. The Lookup Table does exactly what it promises: lookups. These are exact match operations, which are extremely inexpensive to perform, because they can only have a binary result: either the match exists in the data store being queried or it doesn&rsquo t. This performance stays constant even if the data store being queried increases in size.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/the-regex-table-variable-in-google-tag-manager/

Mon, 28 Aug 2017 08:19:25 +0000;Track Users Who Are Offline In Google Analytics;The steady increase in mobile use over the last years has introduced some new challenges for web analytics. It&rsquo s not just about mismatches in the tracking model (the concept of sessions is even more absurd for apps than it is for desktop browsing), but about something more fundamental, more basic. Think about it: if a visitor visits the website using a mobile device, there&rsquo s a significant chance of them losing internet connectivity and going unintentionally offline.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-users-who-are-offline-in-google-analytics/
Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:12:20 +0000;#GTMTips: Pagination And Quick Search;If you open the Google Tag Manager user interface and browser your tags, triggers, and variables, you might notice that the UI now has two new features:.  Pagination, where only 50 results are shown per page.  A quick search / filter bar at the top of each list, which lets you narrow the list down to results that match your query.  Pagination might be a nuisance in large containers, but it was implemented to improve performance.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/pagination-and-quick-search/
Mon, 21 Aug 2017 09:26:17 +0000;Two New Unofficial GA Add-ons For Google Sheets;More often than not, much of what we do in web analytics can be automated.

Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:51:49 +0000;Custom Dimension Manager For Google Analytics;The Custom Dimension Manager For Google Analytics is a Google Sheets add-on. It lets you update Custom Dimensions in any given Google Analytics property en masse.

The add-on is completely free to use.;https://www.simoahava.com/tools/google-analytics-custom-dimension-manager/
Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:51:19 +0000;Google Analytics Validator;The Google Analytics Validator is a Google Sheets add-on. It lets you build a spreadsheet of all the accounts, properties, and views you have access to in Google Analytics. Then, you can select any number of these properties to populate a second sheet, where each Custom Dimension configured in the property is displayed with its name, scope, and active status.  Finally, you can poll for the last 7 days data for any selected property/view to see if the Custom Dimension has collected any hits.;https://www.simoahava.com/tools/google-analytics-validator/

It&rsquo s very possible you&rsquo re running this pixel on a site which already has Enhanced Ecommerce for Universal Analytics implemented, and now you want to use the same Enhanced Ecommerce data that your developers have already made available in this Facebook pixel.. Or perhaps you want to concatenate a list of strings, such as article tags (['culture', 'politics']), and send it as a comma-separated string to Google Analytics ('culture,politics').;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/create-string-multiple-object-properties/
Mon, 26 Jun 2017 07:54:57 +0000;#GTMTips: Send Google Analytics Tag To Multiple Properties;Here we are again, revisiting an old theme. When using Google Tag Manager, we often want to send the contents of the same tag to multiple Universal Analytics properties. With on-page GA, this used to be quite simple, as all you had to do was create a new tracker and then just remember to run the ga('trackerName.send'...) commands to all the trackers (or you could use my duplicator plugin). With GTM, your options are more limited, since Google Tag Manager abstracts the tracker object, giving you far fewer tools to work with.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/send-google-analytics-tag-multiple-properties/
Tue, 13 Jun 2017 08:27:38 +0000;#GTMTips: Use customTask To Access Tracker Values In Google Tag Manager;One of the things I&rsquo ve recommended from the get-go is to always send the Client ID to Google Analytics with your users&rsquo hits. This is very useful for adding a level of granularity to your tracking. At first, I recommended using an Event tag to do this. Then I modified my approach a little so that you could send it with your initial Page View (thus not inflating your hit counts).;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/use-customtask-access-tracker-values-google-tag-manager/
Thu, 11 May 2017 04:05:13 +0000;Google Analytics Settings Variable In GTM;Let&rsquo s face it - most of us use Google Tag Manager for one main purpose: to deploy and configure Google Analytics tracking on a website. I&rsquo d wager that once you start using GTM, you won&rsquo t be implementing Universal Analytics the old-fashioned way, with on-page code, any more. But running Universal Analytics tags through GTM isn&rsquo t yet a perfect workflow. We&rsquo re still missing things like proper plugin support and the option to properly differentiate between the tracker and the hit - both of which are easy to do with an on-page implementation.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-analytics-settings-variable-in-gtm/

GTM just introduced an approval workflow, which allows you to exercise some additional control over what changes are pushed to the live site, or created into versions.. Note that this update also introduced a small change in the regular GTM UI - mainly, the menu that used to have &ldquo Create Version&rdquo , &ldquo Publish&rdquo and &ldquo Preview&rdquo is now changed into a dual button layout with just Preview and Submit as the options.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/new-approval-workflow-gtm-360/
Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:40:54 +0000;Track Autocomplete Search In Google Tag Manager;Autocomplete search is a tricky thing to track. The underlying logic is that when the user starts feeding characters into a search form, the search suggests results based on a limited input. If the user is not satisfied with the results, they can continue adding characters to the search, thus increasing the accuracy. Often there&rsquo s also the option to revert to a regular search with what they&rsquo ve already written. Tracking this logic in tools like Google Analytics is difficult, because there&rsquo s really no way to know if the search was successful.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-autocomplete-search-google-tag-manager/

Far too often, lack of proper communication practices within an organization lead to a release being pushed out without thoroughly testing how this release impacts any existing tracking solutions..  Luckily there are ways to mitigate this. The most significant and impactful precautions you can take are all about process:;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/automated-tests-for-google-tag-managers-datalayer/
Wed, 18 Jan 2017 11:34:13 +0000;#GTMTips: 10 Useful Custom JavaScript Tricks;I recently published a #GTMTips guide called 10 Useful CSS Selectors, and it was very well received. Inspired by the feedback, here&rsquo s the next instalment. This time, we&rsquo re going over some useful JavaScript tips and tricks that you can use to make your Google Tag Manager deployment even more efficient. I&rsquo ve written a lot about JavaScript in this blog, and I intend to keep on doing so in the future. As always, if JavaScript is somewhat of a mystery to you, I strongly recommend you take the Codecademy (free) course on JS, and take a look at the other available web technology tracks while you&rsquo re there!;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/10-useful-custom-javascript-tricks/
Wed, 04 Jan 2017 10:37:16 +0000;#GTMTips: 10 Useful CSS Selectors;Without a doubt, the possibility to leverage CSS selectors in Google Tag Manager&rsquo s trigger conditions is one of the most useful features of the platform. It gives you an amazing amount of flexibility, especially when combined with GTM&rsquo s click and form triggers.. Essentially, CSS selectors let you test an HTML Element against a selector string. This check verifies that the element matches the given selector. In practice, this would mean that when you use the click or form trigger, you can check if the Click Element or Form Element built-in variables match a specific selector, allowing you to confirm that the action happened on the correct element.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/10-useful-css-selectors/
Tue, 13 Dec 2016 10:01:42 +0000;#GTMTips: Change Management With Workspaces;A while ago, the Google Tag Manager team published one of my favorite feature releases in the history of GTM: Workspaces. I was so thrilled by this release that I went ahead and published a guide on how to implement and leverage this new feature.. Workspaces is a very comprehensive feature in Google Tag Manager. This is because it changed the entire underlying data model. We no longer work directly with a single container draft.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/change-management-workspaces/
Wed, 07 Dec 2016 13:27:57 +0000;Log Failed Google Analytics Requests In Google Analytics;READ THIS (26 Aug 2019)!! Unfortunately, the update I made in 2016 contained code that was incomplete and broken. I nevert noticed this until it was pointed out to me almost three years later. At this point, I don&rsquo t have a working backup of the solution, so unless some internet archive / cache service manages to surface the code, this article is basically lost..  UPDATE 20 December 2016: I made some fixes to the solution - be sure to grab the latest code snippet from below!;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/log-failed-google-analytics-requests-google-analytics/
Thu, 01 Dec 2016 06:13:52 +0000;Spam Filter Insertion Tool;I took my Spam Filter Insertion Tool down since it&rsquo s very ineffective for tackling referral spam in Google Analytics. There are far better ways to combat spam.. You can still download the source in the GitHub repository if you want to build the tool yourself.;https://www.simoahava.com/spam-filter/
Mon, 14 Nov 2016 08:59:32 +0000;Google Analytics Client ID In AMP Pages;This article is a collaboration between Simo and Dan Wilkerson. Dan&rsquo s one of the smartest analytics developers out there, and he&rsquo s already contributed a great #GTMTips guest post. It&rsquo s great to have him back here sharing his insight on working with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).. So, we&rsquo re back on AMP! Simo wrote a long, sprawling AMP for Google Tag Manager guide a while ago, and Dan has also contributed to the space with his guide for AMP and Google Analytics.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-analytics-client-id-amp-pages/
Thu, 10 Nov 2016 08:09:09 +0000;Accelerated Mobile Pages Via Google Tag Manager;Google Tag Manager recently published support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). This support comes in the form of a new Container type in Google Tag Manager..  When you create an AMP container in GTM, you are actually setting up an external configuration for AMP, which leverages AMP&rsquo s own analytics module. As befits Google Tag Manager, creating the configuration is done in the familiar Google Tag Manager user interface, and you have (almost) all the tools of regular Google Tag Manager at your disposal.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/accelerated-mobile-pages-via-google-tag-manager/
Tue, 01 Nov 2016 11:58:07 +0000;#GTMTips: Fix The Rogue Referral Problem In Single-Page Sites;Single-page sites (or single-page apps) typically have just one page load. When navigating the site, subsequent content is either uncovered from the DOM, where it&rsquo s been in a hidden state, or loaded from the server using HTTP requests that do not invoke a new page refresh. This behavior, however, has some implications for Google Analytics tracking, especially when configured via Google Tag Manager.. The crux of the problem is this: When you create a Google Analytics tracker, the URL of the page (without a possible #hash) from when the tracker was created is sent as the value of the Document Location field with every hit that uses this tracker.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/fix-rogue-referral-problem-single-page-sites/
Wed, 26 Oct 2016 11:34:28 +0000;Site Speed Sample Rate And Multiple Page Views;Google Analytics&rsquo Site Speed reports are pretty darn great. They report automatically on various milestones in the process the browser undertakes when rendering content. These reports leverage the Navigation Timing API of the web browser, and they are (typically) collected on the first Page View hit of a page.. And this is all fine. As I said, it&rsquo s a great feature of Google Analytics, and lends itself handily to spotting issues in the quite complex client-server negotiation that goes on when your web browser requests content from the web server.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/site-speed-sample-rate-multiple-page-views/
Tue, 18 Oct 2016 15:06:53 +0000;#GTMTips: Restrict Custom HTML Tag Scope;What better way to celebrate the 50th #GTMTips article than, well, a really useful Google Tag Manager tip?! This tip is so useful and simple it encapsulates everything that I had in mind when starting this series. The tip is about restricting scope of Custom HTML Tags. This is an important concept, because it&rsquo s possible that you&rsquo re stuffing your page&rsquo s global JavaScript namespace with all sorts of junk, and thus inadvertently causing conflicts.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/restrict-custom-html-tag-scope/
Wed, 12 Oct 2016 10:16:11 +0000;Introducing GA Spy For Google Analytics;This is a guest post by Stephen Harris from Seer Interactive . He was kind enough to share his awesome solution in this blog, so I&rsquo m very grateful indeed for his contribution.. If Google Tag Manager is loaded as the primary instrument for tracking on a webpage (as it should be), then all webpage tracking could and should be configurable via GTM. But we don&rsquo t always control the circumstances, and it&rsquo s not uncommon to face hardcoded Google Analytics tracking outside of GTM.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/introducing-ga-spy-for-google-analytics/
Fri, 30 Sep 2016 07:44:44 +0000;#GTMTips: Debug Change History In GTM;Google Tag Manager can be quite the hierarchical mess. You have accounts which comprise containers. Containers are split into container versions, and you use workspaces to create new versions. Phew! Trying to keep tabs on all the activity within these layers can be quite the chore.. In this #GTMTips article, I&rsquo ll do a quick walkthrough of (almost) all the places where you can review changes made in your Google Tag Manager account and container.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/debug-change-history-gtm/
Wed, 21 Sep 2016 15:17:54 +0000;10 JavaScript Concepts For Web Analytics Implementation;I&rsquo ve already written extensively about JavaScript in web analytics implementation. Suffice to say, understanding at least the basics is absolutely necessary to survive in the technical medium of the web browser..  This article expands on a conference talk I gave at MeasureCamp IX, London a short while ago. I&rsquo ve always been quite single-minded about the importance of JavaScript in web analytics development, and it was a pleasure for me to get some of that off my chest.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/10-javascript-concepts-for-web-analytics-implementation/
Mon, 29 Aug 2016 15:08:24 +0000;Revamped User Interface In Google Tag Manager;It&rsquo s been a crazy week. Just crazy. Not only did Google Tag Manager introduce Workspaces, arguably one of its most important releases ever for GTM, but they also revamped the user interface! So very big changes have been underfoot, and I&rsquo m so happy to be writing about them, because in my completely biased opinion these changes are amazing and well worth the long wait.. In this article, I want to quickly walk you through what I think are the most meaningful changes in the interface.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/revamped-user-interface-in-google-tag-manager/
Mon, 29 Aug 2016 15:07:35 +0000;Google Tag Manager Workspaces;Well, well, well. Welcome to the Enterprise Game, Google Tag Manager! You know, if you took a look at all the feature requests and complaints that pass through the Google+ community or the Product Forums, you&rsquo d notice that a large portion of them revolve around lack of multi-user and multi-team support in the tool. Well GTM has taken a gigantic leap forward to soothe these concerns, with the release of its latest feature: WORKSPACES.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-workspaces/
Wed, 17 Aug 2016 08:23:06 +0000;Troubleshooting Cross-Domain Tracking In Google Analytics;Cross-domain tracking, in Google Analytics, is the process of passing information stored in browser cookies from one domain to another. Due to web browsers&rsquo same-origin policy, a browser cookie is only available to the domain it is written on and all its subdomains (by default). Since Google Analytics uses cookies to persist the Client ID, once the user moves from domain to domain it&rsquo s important to somehow pass this Client ID, too.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/troubleshooting-cross-domain-tracking-in-google-analytics/
Tue, 02 Aug 2016 13:01:25 +0000;Run Google Tag Manager And Google Analytics In Local Files;Last updated 2 March 2018.. Every now and then you might be urged to run Google Tag Manager and/or Google Analytics locally, meaning without the benefit of a web server serving your files. In other words, you&rsquo re loading an HTML file from your computer in the web browser. You can identify a locally run file by the file:/// protocol in the address bar..  Now, deploying Google Tag Manager onto that file with the hopes of running Google Analytics requests locally isn&rsquo t quite simple.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/run-google-tag-manager-google-analytics-local-files/
Wed, 27 Jul 2016 08:43:20 +0000;#GTMTips: Use eventTimeout With eventCallback;There are times when I&rsquo m disappointed with Google&rsquo s developer documentation, especially for Google Tag Manager. Most of the time they get it right, and I&rsquo d say around 80% of questions being thrown around the forums can be answered just by reading through the documentation. But there are some cases where the documentation is misleading or even downright dangerous. One of these cases is Enhanced Ecommerce.. This isn&rsquo t going to be a thorough critique of said documentation, but the tip in this post has to do with one of the examples that the documentation gives for measuring Product Clicks.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/use-eventtimeout-eventcallback/
Mon, 18 Jul 2016 08:42:34 +0000;Attribution In Enhanced Ecommerce Reports;Enhanced Ecommerce is a very useful set of reports in Google Analytics. They extend the standard Ecommerce funnel, which measures only purchases, and allow you to observe products from the very first impression, through various interactions, all the way to the purchase and even beyond, if the user wanted a refund. Google has some solid documentation on how to implement and interpret Enhanced Ecommerce, but if there&rsquo s one area that would deserve more illumination, it&rsquo s attribution.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/attribution-enhanced-ecommerce-reports/
Wed, 22 Jun 2016 07:31:57 +0000;#GTMTips: Deploy GTM In Your Chrome Extension;Have you created a Chrome Extension, and now you&rsquo re dying to find out how users are interacting with it? Perhaps you want to see what features are (not) being utilized, or perhaps you&rsquo re just interested in knowing if people are actually using it.. In this article, I&rsquo ll show you how to configure Google Tag Manager, so that it works in the restricted sandbox of the Chrome Extension. You&rsquo ll need to make some tweaks, but it&rsquo s still perfectly doable.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/gtmtips-deploy-gtm-chrome-extension/
Wed, 15 Jun 2016 11:47:58 +0000;Content Dashboard With Klipfolio And Google Analytics;I have very little against Google Analytics&rsquo default dashboards. The reason I shy away from them is because they lack the type of customization I&rsquo ve come to expect from a dashboarding tool. On top of that, they only let you look at GA data, and I learned early on in my career that focusing on just one vertical is one of the cardinal sins you can make as an analyst.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/content-dashboard-klipfolio-google-analytics/
Wed, 08 Jun 2016 16:09:45 +0000;Measure Google Tag Manager Event Duration;Google Tag Manager is a great tool. Yeah, you came all the way to this article to read that truism. It also performs really well, loading at a sweet, swift pace even on a slow connection, thanks to pretty decent response times from Google servers. On top of that, the library itself loads asynchronously, meaning the container download doesn&rsquo t interrupt the browser as it tries to make sense of your messy HTML.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/measure-google-tag-manager-event-duration/
Wed, 25 May 2016 10:49:46 +0000;Simple Tracker Duplication For Universal Analytics;First of all, I&rsquo m sorry about the title. I should really stop throwing the word &ldquo simple&rdquo around, since people always tell me that the stuff I claim to be easy and straightforward is rarely so. But since this is my blog, I reserve the right to use whatever stupid and misleading terminology I want. I maintain that what follows IS quite simple, especially when considering the amount of complexity it reduces in your Universal Analytics setup.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/simple-tracker-duplication-universal-analytics/
Tue, 17 May 2016 07:25:04 +0000;#GTMTips: Using document.write Safely In GTM Tags;This article is a guest article by someone from the analytics community I really look up to. Dan Wilkerson is an analytics developer at Bounteous, a company I hold in high esteem. Dan is one of the smartest technical analytics experts out there, and a large bulk of the awesome scripts and hacks that Bounteous produces (almost on a daily basis) have been orchestrated by him.

Mon, 25 Apr 2016 10:02:10 +0000;#GTMTips: The Timer Trigger;Google Tag Manager has a Trigger type which fires after a certain duration of time has passed on the web page: the Timer Trigger. The most common uses for the Timer Trigger seem to be either to send an event to Google Analytics after X seconds of dwell time (to kill the Bounce), or to defer a Tag from firing until some asynchronous request has completed with certainty.. In the previous version of Google Tag Manager, the Timer was a separate listener Tag, which meant that you could start a timer based on a user interaction such as a click.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/timer-trigger/
Mon, 04 Apr 2016 15:11:07 +0000;#GTMTips: 10 Blogs, 10 Articles, 10 People To Follow;Quite a while ago, I wrote an article on what I considered (then) to be my favorite Google Tag Manager resources. Many of them are still very valid, but I still wanted to write a follow-up. Times have changed, and GTM is very different from what it was two years ago when I wrote the post.. So in this article, I want to divert your attention to 10 blogs, 10 articles, and 10 people - all which are and/or share excellent Google Tag Manager content on a periodic basis.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/gtmtips-10-blogs-10-articles-10-people-follow/

Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:11:53 +0000;#GTMTips: Track JavaScript Errors As Events;Back back to the friggin&rsquo basics. Almost two years ago, I wrote a two-parter on how to have fun with Google Tag Manager: Part 1, and Part 2. The first part had a nice exercise for tracking JavaScript Errors as Google Analytics Events, using the recently published &ldquo JavaScript Error Listener&rdquo Tag.. Well, that was in GTM V1. Now we&rsquo ve been smoothly sailing with the wonderful new interface for well over a year, and it&rsquo s time to update some of these nifty tricks.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/track-javascript-errors-events/
Thu, 17 Mar 2016 17:43:03 +0000;Debug Google Analytics On Your Mobile Browser;I&rsquo m currently at SMX München, which is still one of my favorite conferences in Europe. The quality of the talks is superb, and the organization is just perfect. So today, after my talk (joint session with the awesome Dave Sottimano), I was listening to the inimitable Mike King give an excellent presentation together with Ari Nahmani on technical skill prerequisites for all digital marketers today. Needless to say, I strongly agree with their view that digital marketing has always been a technical discipline, and the web is getting more and more complex each day that passes.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/debug-google-analytics-on-your-mobile-browser/
Thu, 10 Mar 2016 16:37:05 +0000;Track Content Engagement Part 2;A couple of days ago, I wrote an article on tracking content engagement. Even though the solution itself works, and it&rsquo s a really neat trick if I can say so myself, it has its problems.. After all the glory I showered on User Timings in Google Analytics, they have one serious flaw: they cap at 10,000 samples per day. What a ridiculous, arbitrary limit.. In any case, this means that if you have enough traffic to accumulate 10K user timing hits per day, it means that the solution I provided in the previous article will not work for you, as the Pageviews will not be capped, meaning the calculation of Total Engaged Time / Pageviews will be skewed.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-engagement-part-2/
Tue, 08 Mar 2016 15:12:31 +0000;Track Content Engagement Via GTM;When looking at Google Analytics reports, you&rsquo d think you get a pretty good idea of how people are interacting with your site, right? I mean, you&rsquo re tracking events here, pageviews there, and user timings, custom dimensions, custom metrics, and calculated metrics are all part of your daily lingo. But you&rsquo re also probably aware of how futile this tracking is. After all, all you&rsquo re seeing are numbers that reflect certain outcomes the visitors have produced on the website, and how these outcomes match against your preconceived goals and objectives, right?;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-content-engagement-via-gtm/
Wed, 24 Feb 2016 09:59:19 +0000;Google Analytics Endpoint Debugger;This is a really cool feature for Google Analytics data collection, of which I&rsquo ve heard very, very little buzz. It&rsquo s a way to debug any and all hits sent to the Google Analytics endpoint at https://www.google-analytics.com/collect..  In all simplicity, you just need to copy the entire URL of the HTTP request to your clipboard, paste it into a web browser, and add /debug between the hostname and /collect.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-analytics-endpoint-debugger/

Can you run Google Analytics using the snippet AND using a Google Tag Manager Tag on the same page?.  There are many facets to this query, so I&rsquo ll try to tackle as many of them as I possibly can.. First, a terminology rant.

Today I want to direct your attention to a dangerous setting found within the bowels of the Universal Analytics Tag template in Google Tag Manager. In fact, GTM itself highly discourages you from meddling with it:.  I actually agree with this warning. It should be highly discouraged, as modifying the tracker name introduces a potential hazard to your tracking plan, unless you know what you&rsquo re doing.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/be-careful-with-the-tracker-name-setting/

Mon, 21 Dec 2015 09:35:12 +0000;#GTMTips: Multiple GTM Containers On The Page;For some reason, you might run into a situation where you need to add multiple Google Tag Manager containers on the same page. Usually this is because of poor governance or an inflexible organization. My recommendation is to fix things in your projects first, and only resort to multiple containers if you can&rsquo t seem to resolve your governance issues using your vocal cords (or your fists).. Officially, Google Tag Manager introduced support for adding multiple containers earlier in 2015.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/multiple-gtm-containers-on-the-page/

Now the correct placement for the JavaScript methods of the container snippet is, indeed, in &lt head&gt .). I want to address something I&rsquo ve been confused about from the very first day since I started using Google Tag Manager. Why on earth would an asynchronously loading JavaScript library be recommended to place in the beginning of &lt body&gt , when the logical place to start loading dependencies is as early as possible in the document load process?;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/gtm-container-snippet-in-the-head/
Wed, 09 Dec 2015 07:40:46 +0000;Firing A Single Tag Multiple Times In GTM;There might be many reasons you&rsquo d want to fire a single Tag multiple times in Google Tag Manager. The most common one is when you want to deploy multiples of a single tracking point on the web. Perhaps you have a roll-up account you want to send the hits to, in addition to the site-specific tracking property.. Quite a while ago, I gave a solution for this with a specific focus on Google Analytics Tags.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/firing-a-single-tag-multiple-times-in-gtm/

I&rsquo ve been doing a lot of work with Swift lately, and I&rsquo m more and more convinced that GTM is actually a very powerful utility for running in your iOS app instead of the Google Analytics SDK..

Thu, 19 Nov 2015 07:27:02 +0000;#GTMTips: Referral Exclusion On Receipt Page;You might have noticed that the Referral Exclusion List in Google Analytics is difficult to maintain. You can&rsquo t copy a list from one property to another, the list is a wildcard match for domain names (so all subdomains are automatically excluded), and it&rsquo s just about the clunkiest user interface we&rsquo ve seen since ERP tools from the 1990s. A while ago, I wrote of a solution which lets you manage referral exclusions using Google Tag Manager, and it&rsquo s still a neat trick, as it&rsquo s way more flexible than said clunky UI.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/referral-exclusion-on-receipt-page/

I&rsquo m psychotically neurotic about data quality. I&rsquo ve written about it many times before, and it&rsquo s pretty much why I want to keep on blogging and writing about analytics and tag management customizations. At eMetrics, I stepped out of my comfort zone of development and implementation, and chose to talk about organization practices.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/from-project-to-process/
Wed, 04 Nov 2015 10:16:04 +0000;Iframe Cross-Domain Tracking In Google Tag Manager;NOTE! This solution has been upgraded, and the new approach can be found here..  If you&rsquo re unfamiliar with the lingo, cross-domain tracking is a hack used by Google Analytics to circumvent the web browser&rsquo s same-origin policy. Essentially, the policy dictates that browser cookies can only be shared with a parent domain and all its sub-domains. In other words, domainA.com and domainB.com do not share cookies.. Since Google Analytics calculates sessions and users by using a cookie, this is problematic.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/iframe-cross-domain-tracking-in-google-tag-manager/

Finally, I have some great use cases to share, as well as some useful examples for implementing GTM for iOS. That&rsquo s right, this is an iOS guide, and, to be more specific, geared towards a successful Swift implementation..

Now, blocking ads and other intrusive content is nothing new, nor do I want to get into a debate about whether it&rsquo s a good thing or not. But as a data geek I&rsquo m very interested in knowing just what share of my site tracking has some content blocker enabled.

Mon, 28 Sep 2015 12:28:30 +0000;Measure SERP Bounce Time With GTM;Here&rsquo s an interesting and hacky use case for you. It&rsquo s all about uncovering bounce metrics for visits which originate from organic Google search results. In particular, the metric we&rsquo re interested in is how long user dwelled on the landing page after arriving from organic Google search AND returned to the search engine results page (SERP) using the browser&rsquo s back button..  The inspiration for this post came from an audience question at the Best Internet Conference in Lithuania, which I recently attended as a speaker.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/measure-serp-bounce-time-with-gtm/
Thu, 17 Sep 2015 11:13:14 +0000;#GTMTips: Check For New User;Every now and then we want to create a bridge between the stateful machines we send data to (e.g. Google Analytics), and the stateless environment where we collect the data itself (e.g. Google Tag Manager). This is not easy. There is no synergy between Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager which would let the latter understand anything about things like sessions or landing pages or Bounce Rates.. One thing we can reliably measure, however, is whether or not the visitor is a New User in Google Analytics.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/check-for-new-user/
Tue, 15 Sep 2015 07:55:45 +0000;Enhanced Ecommerce Tips And Learnings;Enhanced Ecommerce is undoubtedly an excellent feature of Google Analytics. It provides us with a set of reports that truly extend the capabilities of funnel-based website analysis. As I&rsquo ve shown before, it&rsquo s also very useful for tracking other transactional events on your site, such as content engagement..  However, here&rsquo s the thing. It&rsquo s not very easy to implement. Even if you get everything right according to the documentation, there are still quite a number of pitfalls, and many of the learnings emerge only through experience.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-tips-and-learnings/
Fri, 04 Sep 2015 10:35:53 +0000;#GTMTips: Prevent Tag From Firing In iFrame;Unfortunately, iFrames still exist. They are used to embed content from one page into another. Frames are horrible, nasty things, very often riddled with cross-domain problems, performance issues, responsive design obstructions and other crap from the nether pits of hell. Regardless, if you&rsquo re stuck with an iFrame which also collects data to your Google Analytics property, for example, you probably want to prevent at least the first Page View from firing, since otherwise you&rsquo ll be double-counting Page Views: once on the main page and once in the iFrame.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/prevent-tag-from-firing-in-iframe/
Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:56:30 +0000;Track Form Engagement With Google Tag Manager;(Updated 13 August 2017). A little over a year ago, in April 2014, I wrote the post &ldquo Advanced Form Tracking In Google Tag Manager&rdquo , and it&rsquo s been at the top of my best seller list ever since.

Wed, 19 Aug 2015 06:18:10 +0000;Understanding Tag Sequencing In Google Tag Manager;A recent update to Google Tag Manager introduced a feature which has been on the wishlist of many users for a long time.

Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:30:03 +0000;Two Ways To Persist Data Via Google Tag Manager;The web is stateless. It&rsquo s basically blind to your past, and it does a poor job of predicting what you might do in the future. When you browse to a website, the browser requests the page from the web server, and then proceeds to render it for you. This is a detached, clinical process, and any personalized or stateful data transfer is left to the sophistication of your web server.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/two-ways-to-persist-data-via-google-tag-manager/

Add an Exception Trigger to the Tag.  The third option is usually the best if the blocking is just temporary. Exceptions are what used to be called blocking rules in the first version of GTM. To add them is easy enough. In the Fire On step of Tag creation, you can click Create Exceptions, and choose the Trigger that will block this Tag from firing.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/block-your-tags-with-trigger-exceptions/
Fri, 31 Jul 2015 09:33:19 +0000;Form Field Timing With Google Tag Manager;The inimitable Craig Sullivan gave me an idea for a continuation to my latest post on form abandonment tracking. In this short tutorial, I&rsquo ll show you how to track the time users spend on your form fields. We&rsquo re going to use the User Timings hit type, and we&rsquo ll send the data for just one form.

Fri, 24 Jul 2015 08:12:30 +0000;Track Form Abandonment With Google Tag Manager;Form abandonment isn&rsquo t always easy to define. Most often, it refers to when someone starts to fill in an HTML form, but leaves the page without submitting it. As a definition, this works nicely. However, with multi-page forms it naturally refers only to the last page of the form. Also, especially with government institutions, forms can be saved to be submitted later. Here, again, form abandonment must be reconsidered..  In this article, I&rsquo ll go over four different ways to track form abandonment in Google Analytics, using Google Tag Manager to setup the tracking.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-form-abandonment-with-google-tag-manager/

Indices are numbered in order, with the first index always being at location zero (0).

Especially if you have a webstore, the number of referral sources you need to exclude to avoid sessions being split can grow really fast. Also, it&rsquo s not like the list is has the most intuitive UI. Instead of a handy text area where you could just copy-paste stuff, you&rsquo re left with a horrible line-by-line list, and there&rsquo s no way of copying lists across properties or anything useful like that.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/implement-referral-exclusions-via-gtm/

The two features I want to introduce here are Folders in the UI, and code syntax highlighting in Custom HTML Tags and Custom JavaScript Variables..

Mon, 13 Jul 2015 15:11:01 +0000;Measure Cart Value In Enhanced Ecommerce;One of the glaring omissions in the Enhanced Ecommerce reports of Universal Analytics is the ability to calculate cart value for products. Cart value, here, is the value that has been added to the cart.. This value can be used to query for products that have the highest discrepancy between cart value and generated revenue. These are missed opportunities of the highest caliber.. With some Custom Metrics magic, we can, however, get cart value into our reports, and we can find our most and least &ldquo effective&rdquo products with just a glance:;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/measure-cart-value-in-enhanced-ecommerce/
Mon, 06 Jul 2015 08:15:39 +0000;Enhanced Ecommerce With A Custom JavaScript Variable;Enhanced Ecommerce is a very nice improvement to the pretty lame, transaction-based Ecommerce tracking in Universal Analytics. Instead of staring blindly at what happens on a receipt page, Enhanced Ecommerce expands your entire webstore into one large funnel labelled &ldquo Shopping Behavior&rdquo , and you&rsquo re able to zoom in on the Checkout funnel as well. Also, the addition of product-scoped tracking is incredibly useful, and it&rsquo s enabled us to think of any asset (our content, for example) on our site as something we could track through the Enhanced Ecommerce reports.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/enhanced-ecommerce-with-a-custom-javascript-variable/

Clear as day: &ldquo Tracking users across subdomains does not require any additional configuration.&rdquo Also, some of the recent, excellent guides to cross-domain tracking, written by E-Nor and Bounteous enforce the same: you just need a default Universal Analytics Tag in Google Tag Manager.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/cross-domain-tracking-across-subdomains/
Tue, 30 Jun 2015 15:36:59 +0000;#GTMTips: Remember To Flush Unused Data Layer Variables;Here&rsquo s a tip that&rsquo s especially important to anyone working with a single-page application. Google Tag Manager persists items in its data model until you either manually delete the variable and/or its value from the data model, or until the user browses away from the page. There&rsquo s nothing as annoying as the example in the image below, where a value that was set for an earlier Tag is resent with a new Tag, even though the purpose was to leave it out.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/remember-to-flush-unused-data-layer-variables/
Mon, 22 Jun 2015 10:39:53 +0000;#GTMTips: Remove Email Addresses From URL Parameters;PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is something we need to actively combat against when using Google Analytics, as the platform explicitly forbids sending PII to Google Analytics properties in any size, form, or shape.. One of the most common ways of accidentally passing PII to a property is via query parameters. Many email platforms out there, for example, see no problem in including the user&rsquo s email address in the query string, especially when the user follows a link in a newsletter.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/remove-email-addresses-from-url-parameters/

Tip 21: Use the All Pages Trigger correctly  Let&rsquo s face it, All Pages isn&rsquo t really an intuitive Trigger name.

The most visible aspect of Google Analytics&rsquo schema is how it groups, or stitches, the arbitrary, hit-level data coming in from the website into discrete sessions, and these are actually grouped under yet another aggregate bucket: users.. But you already know this.

Mon, 05 Jan 2015 08:20:41 +0000;Variable Guide For Google Tag Manager;(Updated 21 February 2019). The current version of Google Tag Manager was released in October 2014. With the release, we saw a brand-spanking new UI, a lot of new functionalities (revamped auto-event tracking, for example), plus a new terminology to cope with. We moved away from the programming-centric concepts of Macros and Rules to the more tactile variables and triggers.. It&rsquo s difficult to rank the changes. The new Auto-Event Tracking is perhaps most impactful, but the improvements done to triggers and variables, when compared to the previous version of GTM, require attention as well.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/variable-guide-google-tag-manager/

Ever since I implemented Enhanced Ecommerce on my blog a couple of weeks ago, I&rsquo ve been getting such an impressive amount of useful data that it&rsquo s mind-boggling.. In this article, I&rsquo ll walk you through the steps I went to implement the solution, along with examples of the data I can now access through Google Analytics&rsquo reporting interface.

This is most useful for transactions, since a common problem with Google Analytics (traditional) eCommerce tracking is that a transaction hit is sent again upon subsequent entries to the receipt page, for example using the Back button of the browser. In some cases, and this is not a good practice, a receipt e-mail is sent to the user with a link back to the receipt page, where the transaction is sent over and over again upon entry.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/prevent-repeat-transactions/
Tue, 02 Dec 2014 20:24:34 +0000;Trigger Guide For Google Tag Manager;Updated 27 March 2019.  In the new version of Google Tag Manager, one of the most visible and profound changes to the previous version is how tags are fired (and blocked). First of all, there&rsquo s the obvious terminological distinction: we talk about triggers now, not rules. Second, triggers have become an integral part of the tag creation workflow, and as such have far more significance in the user interface than before.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/trigger-guide-google-tag-manager/
Fri, 28 Nov 2014 08:33:27 +0000;Check If Google Analytics Is In The Page Template;One of the recurring problems in migrating to Google Tag Manager is how to make the transition as smooth as possible. Usually it requires that we agree with the developers on a time when the old code is removed, and at that moment we need to make sure the GTM tags point to the right UA code. This is, of course, only one use case for migrations, as some people do the entire migration in a staging environment, and some just don&rsquo t care if they lose a little bit of data along the way.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/check-if-google-analytics-is-in-page-template/
Thu, 27 Nov 2014 11:57:17 +0000;Simple RegEx Table For Google Tag Manager;When our good friends in the Google Tag Manager developer team first introduced the Lookup Table Macro, we were excited. For many of us, it soon became the weapon of choice especially when used as a management and optimization tool for the container itself..  However, the macro wasn&rsquo t considered perfect. In fact, the most frequently heard request had to do with the core functionality of the feature itself: the macro should support operations, that is, predicate logic.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/simple-regex-lookup-table-for-google-tag-manager/
Tue, 25 Nov 2014 17:06:27 +0000;#GTMtips: Fix Problems With GTM Listeners;I&rsquo ve written about this before here and here, but this issue remains probably the biggest problem users have when implementing Google Tag Manager.. Tip 10: Resolve conflicts with GTM&rsquo s listeners  The tip title is actually wrong. You&rsquo re not fixing Google Tag Manager listeners. Rather, you&rsquo re resolving conflicts that other scripts on your page might introduce.. GTM&rsquo s event listening is based on something called event delegation. Event delegation makes use of the document object model (DOM) and its tree-like hierarchy.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/fix-problems-with-gtm-listeners/
Wed, 19 Nov 2014 16:18:42 +0000;Google Analytics And The Page Load;If you use Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, or any JavaScript-based data collection or analytics platform, have you ever stopped to wonder how they actually work? I mean, you obviously care about getting the data in, but are you taking the machinations of these tools for granted?. This is something I&rsquo ve been thinking about for a long while, because I&rsquo m not so sure that many who work with these platforms actually understand how the browser and the web page interact.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-analytics-page-load/

Tue, 28 Oct 2014 15:04:24 +0000;Auto-Event Tracking In GTM 2.0;In the new version of Google Tag Manager, auto-event tracking has received a considerable usability upgrade. It might seem quirky at first, especially if you&rsquo re used to the old auto-event tracking method, but the logic behind the new setup is brilliant..  The most important distinction is that auto-event tracking isn&rsquo t something you control with separate tags anymore. Rather, it&rsquo s now entirely trigger-driven, meaning you activate and specify the auto-event tracking of your choice using tag triggers (triggers are what ye olde folk used to call rules).;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/auto-event-tracking-gtm-2-0/
Wed, 22 Oct 2014 18:15:00 +0000;#GTMtips: Once userId, Always userId;The User ID is definitely one of the coolest things about Universal Analytics, if used correctly.

Fri, 17 Oct 2014 17:00:31 +0000;Tools;I&rsquo ve written a bunch of tools to help you use and debug Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. I&rsquo m neither a professional product developer nor am I a visual designer, and both correlate with how the tools look like and what their user experience is :). Nevertheless, I only create tools that I want to use myself, and being a sort of power-user especially in the development side of things, I do think that these little utilities provide added value to your tag management needs.;https://www.simoahava.com/tools/
Thu, 16 Oct 2014 12:12:42 +0000;Introducing GTM Tools;I&rsquo ve written a completely revamped version of this toolset for Google Tag Manager V2.. Well, I just yesterday published the first of my GTM API tools (the Container Visualizer), and I vowed that I wouldn&rsquo t release the other tools for a number of reasons.. The reasons were good, in my opinion (especially the part about the tools being ugly as crap), but on the other hand I don&rsquo t want to keep anyone away from the amazing potential of the new API.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/introducing-gtm-tools/

Tip 7: Always use .push() with dataLayer  When you assign a value to a variable using the equals ( = ) sign, you are actually reallocating the variable to a new value, and the garbage collection system of the runtime environment sweeps the previous value to bit heaven.. Let&rsquo s put it simply: if you redefine dataLayer after the GTM container snippet, you will break GTM&rsquo s proprietary functions.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/datalayer-declaration-vs-push/
Mon, 06 Oct 2014 07:10:27 +0000;eCommerce Tips For Google Tag Manager;I&rsquo ve noticed that setting up eCommerce in Google Tag Manager (and now the new Enhanced ecommerce) is very difficult for many. I&rsquo m sure part of the problem is that eCommerce is for many users the moment that GTM forces you to take steps in to the developer&rsquo s domain, since it&rsquo s obvious that you&rsquo ll need to add some code to the web page..

Mon, 29 Sep 2014 07:03:16 +0000;#GTMtips: hitCallback And eventCallback;This time we&rsquo ll take a look at two different, JavaScript-y features of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Callback as a concept should be familiar to anyone who&rsquo s ever used a programming language. It&rsquo s basically a piece of code that is passed as an argument to some function, so that when this second function has completed, the callback is executed.. For web analytics, callbacks are hugely important, since they allow you to impose a firing order for your asynchronous tags.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/hitcallback-eventcallback/
Tue, 23 Sep 2014 10:05:17 +0000;#GTMtips: Chain Macros In Lookup Tables;One of the cool things about using a tag management solution is that you can leverage variables like never before. In Google Tag Manager, these variables are referred to as macros, and you can identify a macro with the syntax of {{macro name}}. In this tip I&rsquo ll show you how you can actually call macros from other macros, using a Lookup Table as an example.. Tip 5: Chain Macros In Lookup Tables (And Other Macros)  It&rsquo s not just Lookup Tables, either.;https://www.simoahava.com/gtm-tips/chain-macros-lookup-tables/

As before, I want to write an accompanying post for my session, since there&rsquo s always so much more to say than the time slot allows for. So, the topic of this article is the data model used by Google Tag Manager to process digital data in your data layer.. This post also picks up where I left in my previous foray into the data layer. However, where the first article aimed to be generic (since the data layer should be generic), this post will look at how GTM uses the information in the generic data layer, and how it processes this information to work with the proprietary features of the tool.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-data-model/
Fri, 19 Sep 2014 08:52:02 +0000;Use Page Visibility API With GTM;The Page Visibility API for web browsers is pretty sweet. It lets you poll, using some new properties of the document object, whether or not the current page is visible to the user. Visibility is hidden if the page is not open in the current browser tab instance, or if the browser window has been minimized..  In this post, I&rsquo ll give an example of how features of the Page Visibility API could be used with Google Tag Manager.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/use-page-visibility-api-google-tag-manager/

Sounds like a bug!&rdquo . You&rsquo re wrong. This is one of the awesome features of the GA API, and it&rsquo s key to making your tag setups leaner when sending data to Google Analytics..

Mon, 15 Sep 2014 07:05:09 +0000;The Data Layer;Writing this article is dangerous. Data Layer is two marketers short of becoming a buzz word. This occasion will be heralded by articles such as &ldquo Data Layer Is Dead&rdquo , &ldquo This Developer Implemented A Data Layer And You&rsquo ll Never Guess What Happened Next&rdquo , and other examples of the kind of content generation whose propagation should be prevented by military force.

This tip is just a refresher on how GTM firing and blocking rules work.. Tip 3: Google Tag Manager rules in a nutshell  So, let&rsquo s go through these points one-by-one.. Every tag requires a firing rule to work - this is a given.

It&rsquo s done by utilizing the {{referrer}} macro, which comes out-of-the-box in any GTM setup.. Tip 2: Use {{referrer}} to see where the visitor came from  You might want to also explore the Component Types and create new macros for {{referrer path}} and {{referrer host name}} for example:.

If you know your JavaScript, you know that all variables, functions, objects, resources, and data in the document get rewritten with every page load.

Behind this tragically boring title is a simple solution to many problems with Google Tag Manager&rsquo s auto-event tracking. The common denominator to these problems is poor website markup.

That means that you&rsquo ll have to test your custom listener in a live container (I know, ouch!).

These words will transcend the barriers of time and space, bridging together the physical world and its digital counterpart. You see, in an undisclosed number of hours after the publishing of this blog post, I will be talking at the MeasureCamp unconference on this very subject. Or, I hope I will. The whole unconference thing is somewhat confusing, and it involves lighting-fast reflexes and street smarts for slot selection traits which I sadly lack.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/macro-magic-google-tag-manager/
Tue, 18 Mar 2014 07:17:31 +0000;The Container Snippet: GTM Secrets Revealed;First of all, I&rsquo m sorry for the wacky title. Sometimes I just want to amuse myself. Nevertheless, this post is about the Google Tag Manager container snippet. There&rsquo s nothing secretive about it, but I&rsquo m betting many people have no clue what the snippet really does. That&rsquo s the revelatory part.. If you&rsquo ve never wondered what the snippet does, then shame on you! Remember, you own your page template. It&rsquo s yours. Any code that you write there is your responsibility.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/container-snippet-gtm-secrets-revealed/
Fri, 14 Mar 2014 11:30:08 +0000;Block Internal Traffic With Google Tag Manager;You&rsquo ve probably come across a number of guides or posts talking about why it&rsquo s necessary to block so-called internal traffic from your web analytics reports. The reasons are pretty solid: internal traffic does not emulate normal visitor behavior, it rarely contributes to conversions (skewing up your conversion rate), it inflates page views, and it wreaks havoc on your granular, page-by-page data.. Internal traffic is vaguely described as &ldquo your employees&rdquo , &ldquo people really close to your brand&rdquo , &ldquo your marketing department&rdquo , &ldquo your web editors&rdquo , and so on.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/block-internal-traffic-gtm/
Tue, 11 Mar 2014 12:08:18 +0000;GTM Listener Firing Order Test;Because I was bored, I did a quick test to sort out the firing order of competing GTM listeners. If you&rsquo ve done your homework (i.e. read my article on GTM listeners), you&rsquo ll remember that GTM listeners are set up on the document node of the document object model (DOM). I wanted to test what the firing order is if you have multiple competing listeners on the same page.. I tested with the following listeners (make sure you read up on auto-event tracking if you are completely baffled at this point):;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/gtm-listener-firing-order-test/
Sat, 08 Mar 2014 10:16:24 +0000;Google Tag Manager: The History Listener;There&rsquo s a new listener in town! It&rsquo s a few days now since the Google Tag Manager team unleashed the History Listener, and the time has come for me to tell you what this baby can do.. The History Listener is designed to be used on websites where content is loaded dynamically. Typically, these websites make heavy use of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which is designed for loading content in the background and serving it dynamically without having to reload the page.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-history-listener/
Mon, 03 Mar 2014 19:49:46 +0000;Google Tag Manager: Playing By The Rules;There is a new version of this guide for GTM V2 here.. (Last updated April 2014) I see Google Tag Manager&rsquo s operational model as an analogy of Montesquieu&rsquo s three-branched government theory (don&rsquo t leave just yet, I&rsquo m getting somewhere with this). We have the legislative power of tags (what should be done), the judiciary power of macros (explore the context and circumstance of each tag), and the executive power of rules (make the tag happen).;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-playing-rules/
Sat, 01 Mar 2014 07:49:08 +0000;Tag Management Does Not Make IT Redundant;Here are a few quotes I found on the web regarding tag management and IT departments:. Relief of IT department bottlenecks – once the Tag Manager is deployed, new tags can be implemented directly by Marketing with no IT department involvement. This is a huge benefit for large websites, where IT is oftentimes a bottleneck. Original text here.  IT Issues - when you use a TMS like 'Google Tag Manager' you are bypassing the IT department.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/tag-management-make-redundant/
Wed, 26 Feb 2014 15:06:21 +0000;Some Awesome Google Tag Manager Resources;When push comes to shove, I&rsquo m a pretty lazy guy. I enjoy nothing more than just to stretch my legs on a couch, pick up my iPad, and read what&rsquo s going on in the world. I skip the news, since they&rsquo re just full of depressing stories. Instead, I head over to my favorite Google+ communities to see what&rsquo s new in the blogosphere..

Fri, 14 Feb 2014 10:16:46 +0000;Why Don't My GTM Listeners Work?;Ever so often I come across a Google Tag Manager setup where GTM&rsquo s own auto-event listeners don&rsquo t perform the task they were supposed to. Listener problems seem to be a hot topic in Google+ and the Product Forums as well.. There may be many reasons why your listeners don&rsquo t work, but a very common trend is that you have conflicting JavaScript libraries or scripts running on your page.. Let&rsquo s explore how listeners work before tackling the problem.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/dont-gtm-listeners-work/
Tue, 11 Feb 2014 16:09:20 +0000;Macro Guide For Google Tag Manager;I&rsquo ve written a new Variable Guide for Google Tag Manager, which covers the new GTM UI. This guide is for the old UI.. You might be vaguely familiar with macros if you&rsquo ve ever used a computer. Basically, whenever you perform a complicated task with a simple gesture, or reuse complex code with a simple input mechanism, you&rsquo re using macros. Think keyboard shortcuts.. In Google Tag Manager, this is the essence of macros.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/macro-guide-google-tag-manager/
Sat, 01 Feb 2014 08:54:42 +0000;Google Tag Manager: The Lookup Table Macro;Having just come hot of the press with my latest article on GTM and Content Grouping which, to my delight, Bounteous had written an amazing tutorial on earlier, Brian Kuhn and the amazing Google Tag Manager development team came out with another incredible new feature: The Lookup Table Macro.. In software engineering, a lookup table is an array which takes away a layer of complexity in runtime computation, and replaces it with a simple value assignment based on array indexing.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-lookup-table-macro/
Thu, 30 Jan 2014 16:45:31 +0000;Google Tag Manager: Content Grouping;Content Grouping is a nice new feature from the good folks at Google Analytics. Basically, it allows you to group your content according to a logical structure. You can create up to five Content Groupings, and you can have as many Content Groups within these groupings as you like. The difference between a Content Grouping and Content Group is hierarchy. The second is a member of the first. Read Justin Cutroni&rsquo s post on Content Groupings to get you started.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/google-tag-manager-content-grouping/
Thu, 16 Jan 2014 11:30:03 +0000;Context Is King: Measure Everything!;Have you ever stopped to think about what the chain of events was that led you to a particular decision? Maybe not, but in web analytics it is something that should be considered. After all, there is something counter-intuitive about analytics tools such as Google Analytics, which require us to think in terms of clicks and recorded events that occur on the website, during the visit.. Thankfully, we have evolved as a species, and we no longer place too much emphasis on last click attribution.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/context-king-measure-everything/
Sat, 11 Jan 2014 16:32:37 +0000;Universal Analytics: Send Custom Dimension With Event;(Last updated March 2014) This post is the final chapter of a trilogy. The ultimate refinement, if you will. It all started with my foray into the murky waters of context, when I tested how weather data could be used to provide extra information about site visits. When I wrote that post, I had two trepidations: 1) does sending the API call with every single page view affect site performance negatively, and 2) does forcing the page view call to wait for the API call to complete affect the quality of visit metrics.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/universal-analytics-send-custom-dimension-event/
Fri, 10 Jan 2014 11:54:40 +0000;Universal Analytics: Fire Script Just Once Per Session;There is a new version of this post for GTM V2 here.. While going over my previous post about using weather conditions to segment data in Google Analytics, I started thinking about performance issues. Since I&rsquo m using a visit-scope custom dimension, it seems futile to have it send the weather details with every single page load. The odds of the weather changing drastically during one visit are slim (unless you live in the UK), and I have yet to come up with a good reason to change my on-site behavior because the weather changed from a drizzle to a downpour.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/universal-analytics-fire-script-just-per-session/
Sun, 15 Dec 2013 19:36:31 +0000;How To (Not) Make A Splash;A word of warning. This is not a developers&rsquo post, a guide, or a thought experiment. This is a bona fide rant. Sometimes we just need to vent.. A couple of weeks ago, I checked one of our (inactive) client&rsquo s Google Analytics accounts I still had access to. What I saw in the acquisition report was this:.  See how direct traffic gobbles up a great big share of organic traffic in late October?;https://www.simoahava.com/web-design/how-to-not-make-a-splash/
Thu, 07 Nov 2013 15:02:41 +0000;Google Tag Manager: Track Social Interactions;(Last updated June 2014) Google Analytics provides us with a nifty way of tracking social interactions. With a simple plugin, you can track how many +1s and Likes your pages accumulate.. This guide shows you how to activate social interaction tagging with Google Tag Manager and Universal Analytics. The instructions are for Facebook Likes, Google+ +1s (now deprecated since Google Analytics tracks +1s automatically), Twitter Tweets and Pinterest Pins..

The Google Analytics Summit came and went, and thanks to the Live Stream, everyone could participate. We were treated to a rapid-fire selection of Google Analytics&rsquo new features, and this post sheds light on one of these in particular: automated event tracking in Google Tag Manager.. Auto-event tracking introduces a nice feature, which does what tag managers ought to do: it provides functionality without HTML template editing.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/auto-event-tracking-google-tag-manager/
Sat, 28 Sep 2013 09:09:15 +0000;Track Adjusted Bounce Rate In Universal Analytics;So here we are again. Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager, the dynamic duo, ready to strike again.. First, remember to check my previous two tips for UA and GTM use in custom scenarios:.  Weather as a custom dimension Tracking page load time In this post, I visit the idea of adjusted bounce rate, which I came across a year ago in the Google Analytics blog.. Adjusted bounce rate basically refers to tweaking the traditional bounce rate collection method (single engagement hits / total visits) so that visits which only included a single page view would not count towards a bounce, as long as they met some qualitative requirements.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-adjusted-bounce-rate-universal-analytics/
Fri, 27 Sep 2013 14:49:25 +0000;Page Load Time In Universal Analytics;In Google Analytics, you can monitor your site speed and get a decent overview of what pages are contributing positively and negatively to site speed. The problem with page load time metric is that it&rsquo s an average based on a sample. You can modify the sample rate with setSiteSpeedSampleRate(), but for me that&rsquo s not bloody well good enough.. (UPDATE 28.3.2014: This post is still valid, but an implementation with User Timings is a much smarter way to measure actual page load time.;https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/page-load-time-universal-analytics/

[Last updated June 2014] I&rsquo ve fallen in love with Universal Analytics and Google Tag Manager. Together they form an incredibly powerful tool for marketing professionals. In most cases, I no longer need to post recommendations to my client for yet another page template revision, since with the tag manager in place, I can just add custom code via the admin panel.;https://www.simoahava.com/web-development/universal-analytics-weather-custom-dimension/

Tue, 18 Jun 2013 18:32:55 +0000;Why Learning SEO Is (Probably) Good For You;Before I begin, it is important to note that SEO, as any other facet of web design, covers both technique and purpose. Technique in the sense that SEO comprises a number of de facto guidelines (and accompanying tools) which help improve the search engine friendliness of your website. With purpose I mean the elusive concept of setting goals, and how to pursue them. Both are incredibly important aspects of learning SEO, and it can be argued that one cannot exist without the other.;https://www.simoahava.com/seo/learning-seo-is-good-for-you/
